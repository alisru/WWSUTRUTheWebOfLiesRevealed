# **THE 343 VECTORS OF ERROR**

### **A Geometric Map of Human Deception**

**"Truth is the ratio of 1\. All else is distortion."**

## **1\. THE CORE AXIOM**

A "Logical Fallacy" is not merely a mistake in words; it is a **Data Omission**. It occurs when a specific sector of reality is hidden, distorted, or ignored to force a false conclusion.

Most people try to memorize fallacies as a list of Latin names (*Ad Hominem, Tu Quoque, Post Hoc*). This is inefficient. There are infinite ways to lie, but there are only **7 Dimensions of Reality**.

Instead of memorizing names, we use a **Coordinate System**. Every possible lie exists at a specific intersection of **Space**, **Time**, and **Agency**.

## **2\. THE SYSTEM LOGIC (The Fractal Code)**

To pinpoint an error, we drill down through 3 layers of recursion. The code for every error follows the format: **\[Q.q.c\]**.

### **Level 1: The Plane (Q)**

*The Macro Domain. Which aspect of reality are we looking at?*

* **Q1: Identity (WHO)** – The Agent, The Source.  
* **Q2: Locus (WHERE)** – The Context, The Scope.  
* **Q3: Definition (WHAT)** – The Substance, The Boundary.  
* **Q4: Drive (WHY)** – The Motive, The Intent.  
* **Q5: Method (HOW)** – The Logic, The Process.  
* **Q6: Origin (CAUSE)** – The History, The Trigger.  
* **Q7: Impact (EFFECT)** – The Consequence, The Result.

### **Level 2: The Sense (q)**

*The Lens. Through which filter are we viewing the Plane?* We apply the 7 Vectors *again* to the Plane to find the specific angle of attack.

* *Example:* **Q1 (Identity) . q6 (Cause)** \= We are looking at the *History* of the *Person*.

### **Level 3: The Use (c)**

*The Atomic Metric. What is the physical state of the error?* Once we have the coordinate, we measure the glitch using the 7 Universal Metrics.

* **c1: Existence (Who)** – Is it real? (Sockpuppets, Strawmen).  
* **c2: Magnitude (Where)** – Is the scale correct? (False Equivalence).  
* **c3: Polarity (What)** – Is the definition inverted? (Orwellian Language).  
* **c4: Velocity (Why)** – Is the drive/direction honest? (Moving Goalposts).  
* **c5: Resolution (How)** – Is the method clear? (Word Salad).  
* **c6: Resonance (Cause)** – Does it connect causally? (Non Sequitur).  
* **c7: Limits (Effect)** – Is the boundary respected? (Slippery Slope).

## **3\. HOW TO USE THIS MAP**

When you encounter a deception, do not argue with the *content*. Locate the *coordinate*.

**The Protocol:**

1. **Identify the Plane:** What are they attacking? The Person (Who)? The Definition (What)? The Result (Effect)?  
2. **Identify the Sense:** How are they attacking it? Are they attacking the Person's *History* (Cause)? The Person's *Group* (Where)?  
3. **Identify the Metric:** What is the glitch? Are they fabricating it (Existence)? Exaggerating it (Magnitude)?

**Example:**

* *The Lie:* "We can't listen to his math because he was mean to me 10 years ago."  
* *The Analysis:*  
  * **Plane:** Q1 (Identity) \- Attacking the Person.  
  * **Sense:** q6 (Cause) \- Attacking the Past.  
  * **Use:** c7 (Effect/Limits) \- Poisoning the Well.  
  * **Coordinate:** **\[Q1.q6.c7\]** \- *Fruit of the Poisonous Tree*.
