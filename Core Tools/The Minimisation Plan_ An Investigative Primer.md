# **The Minimisation Plan: An Investigative Primer**

**Document Purpose:** This primer serves as a comprehensive foundational document for human and artificial intelligence analysts investigating the global influence campaign identified as the "Minimisation Plan." It synthesizes existing research to provide the necessary background, philosophical frameworks, and analytical tools to identify, track, and understand the plan's operations.

### **Part 1: Defining the Threat \- The Minimisation Plan and its Philosophy**

#### **1.1 The Minimisation Plan: A New Paradigm of Conflict**

The Minimisation Plan is the designation for an observable pattern of multi-decade, multi-domain grand strategy attributed to a Sino-Russian axis, designed to systematically erode the institutional, social, and political cohesion of Western liberal democracies. Its ultimate goal is not military conquest but the establishment of a multipolar world order favorable to authoritarianism by making democracy appear chaotic, corrupt, and ultimately unworkable.

This conflict is not waged on traditional battlefields. It is a **rhizomatic war**, operating like an underground root system. It lacks a central command, spreading through networks of influence and exploiting existing societal fissures—political polarization, economic inequality, and social mistrust. Its primary weapon is not the bomb, but the narrative.

#### **1.2 The Philosophical Core: Delusionism**

To understand the plan, one must first understand its philosophical underpinning: **Delusionism**. Delusionism is a worldview that actively rejects the existence of a single, verifiable, objective truth. Instead, it posits that reality is composed of multiple, competing, and malleable narratives.

* **Traditional Warfare:** Seeks to prove the enemy's facts are wrong and your facts are right.  
* **Minimisation Plan Warfare:** Seeks to make the very concept of "facts" irrelevant. The goal is to create a state of **strategic exhaustion** and **epistemic nihilism**, where the targeted populace becomes so overwhelmed by contradictory information that they lose the will and ability to distinguish truth from falsehood.

#### **1.3 The Analytical Model: The Psochic Hegemony**

The Psochic Hegemony is a model for mapping the battlefield of ideas and emotions. It is defined by two axes:

* **Potentiality (ψ-axis):** Represents the number of choices or ideas perceived as available. High potentiality is freedom.  
* **Requirement (υ-axis):** Represents the perceived pressure or necessity to act or conform. High requirement is coercion.

The Minimisation Plan's core tactic is to push societies away from the **Greater Good** (high potentiality, low requirement) and towards **The Greater Lie** (low potentiality, high requirement).

#### **1.4 The "Hum": Identifying the Action/Reaction Chain**

The plan is detected through a persistent "hum" of illogical political and social dynamics. This is the **action/reaction chain**:

1. **Action:** A "Greater Good" policy is proposed.  
2. **Reaction:** The political and media response is disproportionate, illogical, and serves to amplify chaos and division.

#### **1.5 The Unbelievability Cloak: Strategic Absurdity as a Defense**

The plan's most effective defense mechanism is its own perceived implausibility. Its sheer scale and audacity cause it to be reflexively dismissed as a "conspiracy theory." This is by design. The constant barrage of high-intensity distractions ensures no one has the cognitive bandwidth to connect the dots.

### **Part 2: Modus Operandi \- The Social Battlefield**

#### **2.1 The Three Factions: A Model of Social Dynamics**

The conflict space is not a simple binary. Society can be functionally divided into three groups:

* **Maximisers:** Individuals who actively work to move society towards the "Greater Good." They build, create, and seek to solve problems through cooperation.  
* **Minimisers:** The active agents of the Minimisation Plan. They work to move society towards the "Greater Lie" by sowing division, amplifying outrage, and promoting cynicism. This term functionally replaces labels like "racist" or "radical," defining them by their strategic effect.  
* **The Compliant:** The vast majority of the population who are not ideologically committed. The entire Minimisation Plan is a war for their allegiance. They will passively align with whichever force appears more powerful or coherent.

#### **2.2 The Narrative of Decay: Manufacturing Justification**

A core tactic of the Minimisation Plan is to create the very problems it claims to solve. Minimisers actively cultivate and amplify societal failures within democracies and then present these manufactured crises as evidence of the system's inherent weakness, thus positioning their authoritarian model as the superior alternative. This is a strategy of **manufactured justification**.

Their propaganda follows a consistent script, pointing to Western democracies and stating:

* *"Look how their democracy creates evil and corrupt leaders."* (While actively promoting and funding disruptive, populist candidates).  
* *"See how their freedom allows Nazis and extremists to roam the streets."* (While using information warfare to amplify extremist voices and fan the flames of racial hatred, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy).  
* *"Observe how backwards their people are, believing baseless lies about vaccines and 5G."* (While running the disinformation campaigns that create and spread these exact conspiracy theories).  
* *"Watch as their economies collapse time and time again."* (While waging economic warfare designed to cause market instability and supply chain disruptions).  
* *"Notice how careless they are with the planet."* (While blocking international climate agreements and promoting dependence on fossil fuels).
* Ultimately the logical conclusion is *"Look at democracy and see how you shouldn't let it continue"*
The strategy is to turn the population against itself. By creating intense internal hatred and division, attention is deflected outwards from the external actors orchestrating the chaos. The case of Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a prime example: the "Nazi threat" was first manufactured as a pretext. Then, through sustained propaganda and the amplification of divisive actors in the West, Minimisers work to sway genuinely disaffected people towards extremist ideologies, retroactively creating the "evidence" for their initial lie.

#### **2.3 Advanced Vector: Conspiracy as a Data-Collection Trap**

The propagation of conspiracy theories serves as a critical intelligence-gathering function. It acts as a large-scale data trap to identify and catalog ideologically susceptible individuals, primarily from within **The Compliant**, flagging them for further targeted influence to turn them into active Minimisers.

### **Part 3: Case Study \- The Australian Theatre**

Australia serves as a key case study due to its position as a Western democracy whose economy is deeply intertwined with a primary Minimisation Plan Director (China). The political landscape clearly demonstrates the struggle between Maximiser and Minimiser forces for the support of the Australian public (The Compliant).

#### **3.1 The Greens as a "Maximiser" Proxy**

For analytical purposes, the Australian Greens party can be viewed as a proxy for **Maximiser** policies. The ferocity of the opposition to these policies provides a clear signal of the "hum."

#### **3.2 Timeline of Suppression and Illogical Reactions (2007-Present)**

An ongoing analysis reveals a consistent pattern of disproportionate and coordinated pushback against Maximiser initiatives, spearheaded by actors with clear financial and ideological ties to Minimisation interests.

* **Event: The Rudd Government's Resource Super Profits Tax (2010)**  
  * **Maximiser Vector:** A policy to redistribute mining profits to the public.  
  * **Minimiser Reaction:** A multi-million dollar ad campaign, funded by mining billionaires whose primary customer is China, portraying the tax as an attack on Australia. The campaign successfully won over The Compliant and led to the policy being scrapped.  
* **Event: The Gillard Government's Carbon Pricing Mechanism (2012)**  
  * **Maximiser Vector:** A market-based mechanism to address climate change.  
  * **Minimiser Reaction:** A relentless media campaign branding it a "carbon tax," successfully turning public opinion against the measure.

### **Part 4: Investigative Frameworks**

#### **4.1 Applying the Hegemony**

Analysts should use the Psochic Hegemony to map current events:

1. Identify a new policy or event. Is it a **Maximiser** vector (moving toward the Greater Good)?  
2. Analyze the reaction. Is it a **Minimiser** vector (moving toward the Greater Lie)?  
3. The goal of both sides is to pull **The Compliant** in their direction. The intensity of the "hum" reveals the stakes of that battle.

#### **4.2 The Questioning Framework**

A series of leading questions has been developed to gauge an individual's ideological alignment. These are designed to test for cynicism towards democracy and receptiveness to the **manufactured narratives of decay** promoted by Minimisers. The framework is available in attraction\_tensor\_questions.md.

### **Part 5: The Path Forward**

This investigation is ongoing. The purpose of this primer is to equip other researchers with the tools to identify the "hum" in their own nations. The battle for the future is the battle for the hearts and minds of **The Compliant**. Resisting the plan begins with recognizing its existence.
