                    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
                    <p>The standard history of Israel is a tragedy of competing nationalisms. <b>The strategic reality
                            is different.</b> For 100 years, the conflict in Palestine has functioned as a "Resource
                        Sink"—a machine that traps great powers (first Britain, now the US) in an unwinnable, expensive
                        quagmire.</p>
                    <p>This briefing argues that the conflict was not just "co-opted" by chance. The "Minimiser Network"
                        (Russia, China, Iran) actively maintains the conflict to bleed the West dry. They use Israel as
                        "Bait" to force the US to spend billions, while simultaneously using the conflict as "Cover" to
                        destroy Western moral credibility in the Global South.</p>

                    <h2>Section 1: The Prototype (1915-1948)</h2>
                    <p>Before the US got trapped, the British Empire was the first victim. The "British Mandate" was the
                        prototype for the resource sink strategy.</p>

                    <h3>The Engineered Failure</h3>
                    <p>During WWI, Britain promised the same land to three different groups (Arabs, Jews, and
                        Themselves). This guaranteed that <i>whoever</i> ruled Palestine would face perpetual
                        insurrection.</p>

                    <h3>The Cost of "Victory"</h3>
                    <p>Between 1922 and 1948, Britain poured millions of pounds and tens of thousands of soldiers into
                        Palestine to stop the fighting they created. It didn't work. By 1947, an exhausted, bankrupt
                        Britain was forced to withdraw. <b>The lesson was clear:</b> You can bleed a superpower to death
                        by trapping them in a "Management" role in this specific territory<a href="#citation-19">.19</a>

                    <p>After 1948, the trap was reset for a new victim: The United States. The mechanism was simple:
                        Create an existential threat to Israel, compelling the US to pay any price to save it.</p>

                            <li><b>The Catch:</b> The US is forced to launch "Operation Nickel Grass"—a massive, costly
                                airlift of tanks and ammo to save Israel.</li>
                            <li><b>The Punishment:</b> In retaliation, Arab nations launch an Oil Embargo. Oil prices
                                quadruple. The Western economy crashes.</li>

                    <p>To understand why Iran is such a deadly enemy today, you must understand that <b>they used to be
                            Israel's closest ally.</b></p>

                    <h3>The Hidden Partnership (Pre-1979)</h3>
                    <p>Under the Shah, Israel and Iran had a secret "Alliance of the Periphery" against the Arab world.
                        It wasn't just diplomatic; it was deep military integration.</p>

                            <p>They built the <b>Eilat-Ashkelon Pipeline</b> together. Iran supplied Israel's oil;
                                Israel helped sell Iranian oil to Europe, bypassing the Suez Canal.</p>

                    <p>When the Shah fell in 1979, the new Islamic Republic inherited all this knowledge. <b>Iran knows
                            Israel's infrastructure, missile tech, and intelligence doctrine because they helped build
                            it.</b> This is not a standard enemy; this is a former partner who kept the blueprints.</p>

                    <h2>Section 4: The Deception (Iran-Contra)</h2>
                    <p>The "Minimisation" theory claims that Western assets can be tricked into arming their own
                        enemies. The proof is the **Iran-Contra Affair (1985)**.</p>

                    <h3>Arming the Enemy</h3>
                    <p>In the middle of the 1980s, while Iran was chanting "Death to America" and "Death to Israel," the
                        US and Israel secretly <b>sold weapons to Iran.</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>The Deal:</b> Israel sent US-made anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles to Iran.</li>
                        <li><b>The Logic:</b> Ostensibly to free hostages, but strategically it kept the Iran-Iraq war
                            going (bleeding both sides).</li>

                        <p>This proves that the "Hostility" is often performative. Behind closed doors, the West was
                            manipulated into sustaining the very regime (Iran) that is now its greatest threat. It was a
                            masterclass in Minimiser deception: using Western assets to ensure the survival of a
                            Minimiser state<a href="#citation-61">.61</a></p>

                    <h2>Section 5: The Double Game (Performative Hostility)</h2>
                    <p>Today, the "Directors" of the Minimiser network (Russia and China) play a sophisticated double
                        game to keep the resource sink efficient.</p>

                    <h3>Russia's "Alibi Network"</h3>
                    <p>Russia manages to be everyone's friend and nobody's enemy:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Friend to Israel:</b> Russia allows Israel to bomb Iranian targets in Syria
                            (deconfliction). This keeps Israel from feeling totally abandoned.</li>
                        <li><b>Friend to Hamas:</b> Russia hosts Hamas leaders in Moscow and protects Iran at the UN.
                            This keeps the "Axis of Resistance" strong.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>The Goal:</b> "Controlled Chaos." Russia ensures Israel is threatened enough to spend billions
                        on defense, but not threatened enough to start a WWIII that would drag Russia in.</p>

                    <h3>China's "Silent Supply"</h3>
                    <p>China plays the "Peacemaker" at the UN while its companies supply the tech. Chinese components
                        are regularly found in Iranian missiles and Hamas drones. They profit from the trade (Israel)
                        and the war (Iran) simultaneously.</p>
