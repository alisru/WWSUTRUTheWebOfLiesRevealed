### **Sub-bucket 5.6: Suppression of the Australian Greens \- A Chronological Analysis**

The Australian Greens, a political party whose platform is built on a foundation of 'greater good' policies, represents a systemic challenge to the established economic and political order in Australia. Consequently, the Greens have been the target of a sustained, well-funded, and increasingly sophisticated campaign of suppression. This is not the normal exchange of democratic debate; it is a coordinated counter-offensive designed to neutralize a political threat. The ferocity of this opposition constitutes a clear "hum"—a disproportionate and illogical reaction to policies that, while disruptive to vested interests, aim for a broader public benefit.

#### **Phase 1 (2010-2014): The Balance of Power and the Forging of the Playbook**

The period following the 2010 federal election, which resulted in a hung parliament, marks the beginning of the modern, intensified campaign against the Greens. By signing a formal agreement with the Australian Labor Party to form a minority government, the Greens, led by Bob Brown, gained unprecedented influence over the legislative agenda. This triggered a backlash from Minimiser-aligned actors, establishing the tactical playbook that would be used against them for the next decade.

* **The Carbon Tax (2011-2014):** The Greens were instrumental in the design and passage of the Gillard Government's carbon pricing mechanism. The strategic intent of the policy was to create a market-based system to reduce emissions, a 'greater good' objective. The reaction was a textbook example of the "hum." A coalition of the Liberal-National Opposition, the fossil fuel industry (via the Minerals Council of Australia), and allied media outlets (led by News Corp) waged a multi-year "Axe the Tax" campaign. The "Bait" was the protection of households from rising electricity bills; the "Cover" was the framing of the policy as a "toxic tax" that would destroy the economy; the "True Intent" was to protect the profits of the fossil fuel industry. The campaign was successful, contributing to the defeat of the Labor government in 2013 and the repeal of the legislation in July 2014 \[8\].

#### **Phase 1b (2010-2013): The Abbott Gambit \- An Engineered Installation?**

An analysis of this period through the Minimiser framework supports the premise that the campaigns against the Resource Super Profits Tax (RSPT) and the Carbon Tax were not merely defensive actions by industry, but a coordinated offensive gambit designed to achieve a specific political outcome: the installation of Tony Abbott as Prime Minister. Abbott, who became Opposition Leader in December 2009, was the ideal vector for Minimiser objectives due to his implacable hostility to climate action and his deep ideological alignment with the incumbent resource sector.

The "noise" against the Labor government's tax policies was amplified by a core group within Abbott's shadow ministry whose personal and financial interests were closely tied to the sectors that stood to lose the most. Key actors in this gambit included:

* **Joe Hockey (Shadow Treasurer):** As the Coalition's chief economic spokesperson, Hockey was the primary political voice attacking the economic modeling of the taxes. An examination of Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) disclosures for the 2010-2013 period shows the Liberal Party received substantial donations from the financial services and mining sectors, constituencies Hockey actively courted \[9\].  
* **Andrew Robb (Shadow Minister for Finance):** Robb was a key strategist for the Coalition's campaign. His subsequent career move—accepting a high-paying consultancy with the Landbridge Group, the Chinese company that secured the 99-year lease of the Port of Darwin, a deal he was involved in—demonstrates a clear nexus between his political actions and the interests of entities aligned with the Minimisation Plan's primary state actor \[10\].  
* **Ian Macfarlane (Shadow Minister for Resources and Energy):** Macfarlane was the Coalition's direct liaison with the mining and energy lobby. His fierce opposition to the taxes was followed by a post-political career as the Chief Executive of the Queensland Resources Council, a major industry lobby group, illustrating the "revolving door" that solidifies the alignment between political actors and Minimiser-adjacent industries \[11\].

The strategic intent of this gambit appears to extend beyond the repeal of specific taxes. By creating a political environment of perpetual crisis and successfully deposing one government (Gillard/Rudd) and installing another (Abbott), the Minimiser-aligned domestic actors demonstrated their capacity to veto sovereign policy and dictate the political leadership of the country. The beneficiary was not just the mining industry, but the Minimisation Plan itself, which secured a compliant Australian government deeply hostile to the 'greater good' policy of global climate action.

#### **Phase 2 (2015-2021): Institutionalizing the Opposition**

With the carbon tax repealed, the suppression campaign shifted to institutionalizing the anti-Greens narrative and building dedicated vehicles to attack them.

* **The Rise of Advance (2018):** The right-wing lobby group Advance (originally Advance Australia) was launched in 2018, explicitly to counter the influence of progressive groups. Analysis of its leadership reveals deep ties to the conservative side of politics; its founding board included figures like Gerard Benedet, former chief of staff to a Liberal National Party minister \[1\]. The systemic impact of groups like Advance is to create a permanent campaign infrastructure that can be activated to run misleading and aggressive advertising against the Greens, funded by opaque sources, thereby bypassing traditional party-based accountability.

#### **Phase 3 (2022-Present): The "Blockers" Narrative and Electoral Warfare**

The 2022 federal election saw the Greens achieve their best-ever result, winning a record number of seats in both houses and securing the balance of power in the Senate. This success triggered the most aggressive suppression campaign to date.

* **The "Blockers" Narrative (2023):** During the 47th Parliament, the Greens used their balance of power to negotiate on Labor's Housing Australia Future Fund. For delaying the bill for several months in mid-2023 to secure an additional AUD 1 billion for public housing, they were relentlessly attacked by both the Labor government and media commentators, who branded them "blockers." This narrative illogically twisted the Greens' attempt to secure more ambitious 'greater good' outcomes on the housing crisis into an act of obstruction. The strategic intent was to create a systemic impact where any attempt by a minor party to use its legitimate democratic mandate to negotiate for better outcomes is framed as chaos and extremism, thereby reinforcing the power of the two-party status quo.  
* **The 2025 Election Campaign:** The 2025 election saw the campaign escalate dramatically. Advance amassed an AUD 15.6 million election war chest. Analysis of Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) disclosures reveals its funding comes from wealthy individuals with ties to the fossil fuel and finance industries. A key benefactor is the Cormack Foundation, the Liberal Party's main investment vehicle, which has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars specifically for anti-Greens campaigns \[1, 2\]. Advance ran relentlessly negative campaigns branding the Greens as "extreme" and "reckless," a narrative amplified by outlets like News Corp \[3\]. This tactic mirrors those used by similar Minimiser-aligned groups in other Western nations, such as the "TaxPayers' Alliance" in the UK, which also uses populist rhetoric to attack green policies and progressive taxation under the guise of fiscal responsibility, despite being funded by opaque corporate interests \[4\].

### **Sub-bucket 5.7: Domestic Destabilisation (Housing & Food Weapons)**

Australia's chronic housing affordability crisis is not an accidental market failure; it is the direct and predictable outcome of a set of tax policies that have been deliberately maintained for decades. These policies—specifically negative gearing and the Capital Gains Tax (CGT) discount—function as a powerful vector for social and economic attrition. According to analysis of Australian Taxation Office (ATO) data by the Grattan Institute, the benefits of these tax concessions flow disproportionately to the highest income earners; in 2019-20, the top 10% of income earners received over 50% of the total benefit from negative gearing \[5, 6\].

The foundation of Australia's food security is being systematically undermined by a second domestic vector: the extreme concentration of its supermarket sector. The grocery market is dominated by a duopoly of Coles and Woolworths, who together control approximately 67% of the market. A 2024 review by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) heard extensive testimony from suppliers who were afraid to raise issues for fear of commercial retribution, including delisting of their products \[7\]. This dynamic serves the Minimiser goal of domestic destabilisation by creating a constant 'hum' of public anger over the cost of living, which is then directed at the Australian government for failing to control corporate power, thereby eroding trust in democratic institutions.
