# **The Permitted Fire: An Analysis of Strategic Inaction and Threat Triage in the Australian Theatre**

## **Section I: Executive Summary**

This report presents a strategic analysis of the Australian government's response to the rise of domestic neo-Nazi actors, including Thomas Sewell and the National Socialist Network (NSN). Evaluated through the analytical frameworks of the Minimisation Plan and the Psochic Hegemony, the evidence indicates that the government's permissive stance is not a failure of policy but a deliberate, sophisticated strategy of "Compliance Management" and "Threat Triage." This strategy, while preserving the stability of the administrative state, ultimately serves the long-term objectives of the Minimisation Plan by allowing the degradation of Australia's domestic social and informational environment.

The government's response to the violent activities of the NSN, particularly the attack on the Camp Sovereignty Indigenous protest site, was characterized by a minimalist approach of narrative management and de-escalation. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's framing of rally attendees as "good people" with "legitimate concerns" was a calculated act designed to manage the allegiance of "The Compliant"—the ideologically uncommitted majority—and prevent their permanent capture by Minimiser actors.

This approach is one component of a broader "Threat Triage" doctrine, which reveals a clear hierarchy of priorities. Threats targeting the apparatus of the state, such as foreign-sponsored subversion, are met with a maximalist and punitive response. Conversely, threats targeting the social fabric, including domestic extremism and disinformation, are met with permissive, managerial, or complicit inaction. This doctrine prioritizes the integrity of the state over the health of society.

When mapped on the Psochic Hegemony, the government's key strategies, such as its weak misinformation legislation and its handling of domestic extremism, consistently fall within the "Greater Lie" quadrant. They are framed as proactive initiatives for the public good but function extractively, draining social cohesion and public trust to achieve narrow political objectives. The inaction against neo-Nazis is therefore not an oversight but a functional component of a broader strategy to manage dissent, neutralize political opponents, and maintain a chaotic information environment conducive to the long-term goals of the Minimisation Plan. Responsibility lies with an executive leadership executing a sophisticated strategy of controlled demolition, which prioritizes its own power and the stability of the state, even at the cost of the nation's democratic and social health.

## **Section II: The Anatomy of a Permitted Threat**

The Australian government's response to domestic extremism cannot be assessed in a vacuum. It must be understood in the context of the tangible, violent threat posed by actors like Thomas Sewell and his neo-Nazi organization, the National Socialist Network (NSN). Their activities demonstrate a persistent vector of violence and social division, against which the government's subsequent actions represent a deliberate strategic choice.

### **Event Reconstruction: 'March for Australia' and the Attack on Camp Sovereignty**

On August 31, 2025, a series of anti-immigration rallies under the banner "March for Australia" took place in cities across the nation. These events were explicitly promoted by far-right political figures and were directly linked to the NSN.1 In Melbourne, Thomas Sewell, the established leader of the NSN, addressed the crowd from the steps of the Victorian parliament to "huge cheers," outlining a violent vision for his followers in the "fight for \[Australia's\] survival".1

Following the rally, the event escalated from political speech to organized violence. A group of approximately 50 men dressed in black, including Sewell, stormed the nearby Camp Sovereignty, a long-standing First Nations protest site and sacred space.3 The assault was unprovoked and brutal. Assailants were filmed carrying "pipes, poles, and branches," stomping on a sacred fire, and physically assaulting those present, appearing to specifically target women.3 The attack resulted in multiple injuries; Ambulance Victoria confirmed a woman was hospitalized for upper body injuries, and camp organizers reported that two people were taken to hospital with severe head injuries.3 This sequence of events establishes the incident not as a political protest that spiraled out of control, but as a premeditated act of violent, targeted intimidation.

### **Profile of the Threat Actor: Thomas Sewell and the NSN**

The government's response was formulated with full knowledge of the actors involved. Thomas Sewell is not a fringe commentator but a self-appointed neo-Nazi leader with a documented history of promoting white supremacy and engaging in violent criminal conduct.6 His criminal record includes a prison sentence for a violent 2021 attack on hikers in Victoria's Cathedral Range and a guilty verdict for affray and recklessly causing injury in a separate incident involving a Channel Nine security guard.6 At the time of the Camp Sovereignty attack, Sewell was already on bail for other alleged offenses, including the intimidation of a police officer.8

Following the attack, Sewell was arrested and faced 25 charges, including violent disorder, affray, and assault.6 During his bail hearing, Victoria Police argued he posed an "unacceptable risk to society," citing his group's "documented history of hate crimes" and the risk of "serious injury or death" to anyone who opposed them.10 This extensive public record of violent extremism is critical; it demonstrates that the government was dealing with a known, recidivist violent actor, rendering its subsequent de-escalatory response a conscious strategic choice rather than a misjudgment based on incomplete information.

### **Deconstructing the Government's Response: The "Good People" Gambit**

In the aftermath of the rallies and the attack, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's response was "notably nuanced and de-escalatory".1 He publicly downplayed the significance of the turnout, stating, "They weren't big numbers".1 More significantly, he deliberately drew a distinction between the extremist organizers and the thousands of attendees. He asserted there was "no doubt" that "good people" had attended the rallies, driven by "legitimate concerns" about the cost of living and housing.1

Albanese explicitly warned against confrontational responses that might push these individuals "further down that rabbit hole," framing the issue as one where vulnerable people were being manipulated by bad actors, rather than one of inherent extremism among the attendees themselves.1 This framing was a consciously chosen and potentially controversial line, causing "notable unease" within the Labor caucus.1

This was not a political gaffe but a sophisticated psychological operation. The primary battleground of the Minimisation Plan is the allegiance of "The Compliant"—the vast, ideologically uncommitted segment of the population.11 A blanket condemnation of thousands of rally-goers as racist would be a losing strategy, serving only to alienate them and cement their shift towards Minimiser ideologies. Albanese's statement, by contrast, separates the

*identity* of the person ("good people") from their *behavior* (attending a neo-Nazi-linked rally). It validates their underlying grievances ("legitimate concerns") while invalidating the extremist channel they chose for their expression. This provides an "off-ramp" for attendees to disavow the NSN's leadership without having to admit personal fault, allowing them to retreat to the political center where Labor can then compete for their votes on those same "legitimate concerns." It was a calculated act of "Compliance Management" that prioritized the political management of a key demographic over direct ideological confrontation with extremism.1

## **Section III: The Doctrine of Threat Triage**

The government's permissive response to the NSN is not an isolated incident but part of a consistent and calculated doctrine of "Threat Triage." This doctrine involves categorizing and responding to threats based on their nature and their primary target, revealing a clear hierarchy of priorities. This hierarchy consistently values the integrity and security of the administrative state apparatus above the health and cohesion of the domestic social fabric.1

### **Comparative Analysis of Government Responses**

A comparative analysis of the government's actions against different threats makes this doctrine undeniable:

* **Threat 1: Domestic Extremism (NSN):** The response is minimalist, characterized by "Narrative Management & De-escalation." The strategic function is to manage the social fallout of extremist actions and, crucially, to prevent the permanent alienation of "The Compliant" faction, thereby maintaining social stability over confronting ideology.1  
* **Threat 2: State-Sponsored Subversion (Iran):** The response is maximalist, described as "Decisive & Punitive." When intelligence indicated the Iranian regime had directed antisemitic attacks on Australian soil, the government's reaction was swift and severe. It publicly accused the regime, expelled its envoy, and moved to list the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization. The stated justification was the protection of national security, demonstrating a zero-tolerance policy for threats directed at state sovereignty by another state actor.1  
* **Threat 3: Domestic Political Disinformation (Advance Australia):** The response is one of passive complicity, or "Strategic Silence." The government has offered no public condemnation of this well-funded, Minimiser-aligned group, even as it runs aggressive disinformation campaigns against Labor's political rivals, particularly the Greens. This silence is electorally advantageous, allowing a proxy to weaken an opponent while Labor maintains a veneer of civility.1  
* **Threat 4: Corporate-Facilitated Misinformation (Social Media Platforms):** The response is permissive and co-regulatory. The government's proposed misinformation bill is a "Strategic Sponge" that creates the *performance* of governance through committees and consultations, but ultimately leaves platforms to regulate themselves. This maintains the core infrastructure of Delusionism while absorbing political pressure to act.1

The stark disparity in these responses is visually codified in the following matrix, which illustrates the government's operational priorities.

The following table:

**The Albanese Government's Threat Triage Matrix**

| Threat Actor | Threat Type | Primary Target | Government Response | Stated Justification | Strategic Function (per Minimisation Plan) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **National Socialist Network (NSN)** | Domestic Extremism & Social Division | Social Fabric (Minority groups, public discourse) | Narrative Management & De-escalation | Avoid alienating citizens with "legitimate concerns" | Manage 'The Compliant'; maintain social stability over confronting ideology 1 |
| **Iranian Regime** | State-Sponsored Subversion | State Apparatus (National security, sovereignty) | Decisive & Punitive (Expulsion, terror listing) | Protecting national security | Defend the state apparatus from external actors 1 |
| **Advance Australia** | Domestic Political Disinformation | Political Opponents (Greens, democratic norms) | Strategic Silence / Passive Complicity | N/A (No public response) | Allow a proxy to weaken a rival; maintain a chaotic information space 1 |
| **Social Media Platforms (Meta)** | Corporate-Facilitated Misinformation | Social Fabric (Shared factual basis, public trust) | Co-regulatory / Permissive Legislation | Balancing free expression with safety | Maintain the infrastructure of Delusionism; absorb political pressure 1 |

The pattern revealed by this matrix is unambiguous. The intensity of the government's response is directly proportional to the degree to which a threat targets the apparatus of the state (sovereignty, security agencies, international relations) and inversely proportional to threats that target the social fabric (public discourse, social cohesion, democratic norms).

This doctrine creates a dangerous symbiosis with the objectives of the Minimisation Plan. The plan operates by manufacturing crises to demonstrate that democracy is inherently chaotic and unworkable.11 One of its core propaganda narratives is: "See how their freedom allows Nazis and extremists to roam the streets".11 By permitting the "fire" of domestic extremism to burn, managed but never extinguished, the government's minimalist response provides the retroactive "evidence" for the initial Minimiser lie. The government's strategy, designed for domestic political management, thus creates a self-fulfilling prophecy that serves the strategic goals of the external actors orchestrating the chaos. The state is preserved, but society is degraded—the ultimate objective of the Minimisation Plan.

## **Section IV: The Strategic Logic of Inaction: Managing 'The Compliant'**

The rationale behind the Threat Triage doctrine is not rooted in weakness or incompetence but in a calculated political strategy. The government permits the fire of domestic extremism because its primary objective is not to defeat the ideology but to manage the allegiance of the great, uncommitted middle of the population, a faction the Minimisation Plan framework identifies as the conflict's center of gravity: "The Compliant".11

### **'The Compliant' as the Center of Gravity**

The Minimisation Plan posits that society is functionally divided into three groups: Maximisers (who build), Minimisers (who destroy), and The Compliant.11 The Compliant constitute the vast majority of the population. They are not ideologically committed and will passively align with whichever force appears more powerful or coherent. The entire Minimisation Plan is a war for their allegiance.11 The thousands of attendees at the "March for Australia" rallies, whom Prime Minister Albanese labeled "good people," are the physical embodiment of this target demographic. They are motivated by real-world pressures like housing and cost of living, and are therefore susceptible to Minimiser narratives that blame external factors like immigration for their problems.1

### **Inaction as a 'Compliance Management' Strategy**

The government's de-escalatory response to the rallies is explicitly identified as a "Compliance Management" strategy.1 Its purpose is to prevent the full capture of The Compliant by Minimiser actors. A harsh, condemnatory crackdown on thousands of citizens could easily be framed by extremists as an elite, out-of-touch government attacking ordinary people for expressing their concerns. This would be a major propaganda victory for the far-right, likely cementing the allegiance of many attendees to their cause.

By separating the people from the ideology ("good people," "legitimate concerns"), the Prime Minister's strategy aims to build a bridge for these disaffected citizens to return to the mainstream political discourse.1 It keeps them in a political space where the Labor party can compete for their support on the basis of those same "legitimate concerns," rather than ceding them entirely to the extremist fringe. This approach prioritizes social stability and the management of political demographics over a direct and potentially alienating confrontation with extremist ideology.

This specific tactic is consistent with the broader pattern of "controlled demolition" identified in the government's handling of the Indigenous Voice to Parliament referendum.12 In that case, a "Maximiser" policy was architected for failure to manufacture a divisive national debate, exhaust progressive movements, and allow Labor to position itself as the "sensible center." Here, a "Minimiser" threat is managed—not eliminated—for the same strategic purpose: to allow the government to position itself as the only reasonable manager of a chaotic society, distinct from the "extreme" right (NSN) and the "unrealistic" left (Greens). The continued, low-level existence of the threat becomes politically useful for a government seeking to consolidate power in the center.

## **Section V: Mapping the Deception on the Psochic Hegemony**

The government's strategy can be formally mapped and its deceptiveness quantified using the Psochic Hegemony framework.13 This model assesses actions based on two axes: the Moral Question (

υ: Who benefits?) and the Volitional Question (ψ: What is its mode of action?). Actions that are framed as a "Greater Good" (top-right quadrant: \+υ, \+ψ) but whose true effect is extractive or destructive (bottom-right quadrant: −υ, \+ψ) are defined as a "Greater Lie." The distance between the framed vector and the true vector is a direct measure of the action's dishonesty.13

### **Case Study 1: The Misinformation Bill as a "Strategic Sponge"**

* **Framed Vector (+υ, \+ψ):** The *Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2024* is publicly presented as a proactive (+ψ) move for the "Greater Good" (+υ) of creating a safer online environment for all Australians.1  
* **True Vector (−υ, \+ψ):** The bill is proactive (+ψ) in that it initiates a complex and lengthy process of public consultation and parliamentary committees. However, its true function is extractive (−υ). By explicitly prohibiting the regulator from removing content and delegating enforcement back to the platforms, the bill maintains the status quo.1 It functions as a "Strategic Sponge," absorbing years of political pressure, public concern, and activist energy. The outcome is a drain on social cohesion and public trust, as the channels for Minimiser influence remain open while democratic institutions appear responsive but are ultimately ineffectual. The strategy preserves the chaotic information environment that serves Minimiser objectives.1  
* **Conclusion:** The bill is a textbook "Greater Lie." The significant gap between its stated intent and its actual function reveals a deliberate act of political deception.1

### **Case Study 2: The Response to the NSN**

* **Framed Vector (+υ, \+ψ):** The government's de-escalatory response is framed as a proactive (+ψ) and wise act of leadership for the "Greater Good" (+υ) of maintaining national unity, promoting social harmony, and preventing the further radicalization of vulnerable citizens.1  
* **True Vector (−υ, \+ψ):** The response is proactive (+ψ) in its sophisticated narrative management. However, its true function is profoundly extractive (−υ). By refusing to take decisive action to confront the ideology, it normalizes the presence of violent extremists in public life. It extracts safety and security from targeted communities—particularly First Nations and minority groups—and degrades the quality of democratic discourse for the entire nation. It sacrifices the collective's long-term social health for the government's narrow, short-term political goal of managing a key demographic.  
* **Conclusion:** This response also maps squarely to the "Greater Lie" quadrant. It is a deceptive strategy that prioritizes political expediency over the fundamental responsibility to protect citizens from hate-fueled violence.

These two policies are not separate but represent a single, coherent strategy operating on two fronts. The "Strategic Sponge" of the misinformation bill creates a permissive *digital* environment where hate and disinformation can flourish. The "Compliance Management" strategy for the NSN creates a permissive *physical* environment where the consequences of that online hate can manifest as real-world violence. The failure to regulate the infrastructure of hate directly enables the violence that the government then chooses to manage permissively. This creates a self-sustaining loop that perfectly aligns with the Minimisation Plan's core philosophy of Delusionism, where the goal is to create a state of strategic exhaustion and make the very concept of "facts" irrelevant.11 The government's strategy, designed to maintain its own power, becomes the primary engine for the erosion of the very democratic society it purports to lead.

## **Section VI: Conclusion: The Architecture of Responsibility**

The cumulative evidence, synthesized through the provided analytical frameworks, leads to a coherent set of conclusions that directly address the core questions of this investigation. The Australian government's failure to take decisive action against neo-Nazis like Thomas Sewell is not an oversight, a weakness, or a miscalculation. It is the intended outcome of a deliberate and sophisticated political strategy.

**Why is Australia not taking decisive action?**  
Decisive action, such as the proscription of the NSN as a terrorist organization or the unequivocal condemnation of its supporters, is not being taken because inaction is the strategy. A direct confrontation would disrupt the delicate political calculus of "Compliance Management." It would risk alienating a segment of "The Compliant" that the government believes it can manage and eventually win over. The government prioritizes the political management of the populace over the ideological defeat of extremism. The existence of a managed, low-level extremist threat also serves as a useful political foil, allowing the government to position itself as the only "sensible" alternative to the chaos on its right and the "ideological purity" on its left.  
**Who is responsible for allowing this?**  
Responsibility lies with the executive leadership of the Australian government, specifically with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who has personally articulated and defended this strategy. The pattern of behavior is too consistent across different policy domains to be accidental. It is not a failure of the system but the successful implementation of a top-down doctrine of "controlled demolition" and "Threat Triage." This doctrine dictates that the state's administrative stability and its international relationships are paramount, even if protecting them comes at the expense of the domestic social fabric.  
**What have people in power done in response?**  
In response to neo-Nazi activities, people in power have engaged in sophisticated narrative management, downplaying the scale of the threat, making calculated appeals to the "legitimate concerns" of disaffected citizens, and creating legislative "sponges" that absorb public pressure for action while ensuring no substantive change occurs. They have demonstrated a capacity for swift and decisive action, but have reserved it exclusively for threats that directly challenge the apparatus of the state.  
**How does this compare to their actions against threats that oppose the Minimisation Plan?**  
The comparison is stark and damning. Threats to social cohesion and democratic norms, such as neo-Nazis and disinformation, are managed, permitted, or even passively leveraged for political gain. In contrast, threats to the state's integrity, such as foreign-sponsored subversion, are crushed. Political opponents who advance "Maximiser" policies that challenge the status quo, such as the Greens, are strategically undermined, sometimes with the tacit assistance of Minimiser-aligned proxies like Advance Australia.  
This reveals a government whose primary function is to preserve its own power and the stability of the administrative state. By allowing the internal social and informational environment to degrade, it inadvertently—or deliberately—advances the core objectives of the Minimisation Plan, which seeks to prove that liberal democracy is unworkable. The permitted fire of extremism serves to burn away the social trust and cohesion that are the true foundations of a healthy democracy.
