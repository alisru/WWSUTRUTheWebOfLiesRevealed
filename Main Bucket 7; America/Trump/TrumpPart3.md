# **Phase IV Deepening \- Anomalous Vectors and Systemic Capture (April \- September 2025\)**

## **Executive Summary: The Deepening of Phase IV**

This report continues the investigation into the second Donald Trump administration, focusing on the period from April to September 2025\. This phase is marked by a strategic deepening of the Minimisation Plan's Phase IV, "The Great Unravelling." While the initial months focused on seizing the administrative state and fracturing foreign alliances, this subsequent period introduced new, more sophisticated vectors of attack designed to accelerate systemic erosion through weaponized unpredictability and legislative capture.

The investigation has identified three new primary vectors. The first is the "TACO" (Trump Always Chickens Out) trade phenomenon, a seemingly erratic cycle of aggressive tariff threats followed by abrupt reversals.1 Analysis reveals this is not a sign of failed policy but a deliberate tactic to induce strategic exhaustion by injecting radical uncertainty into the global economic system, making rational planning by allies and adversaries impossible.

The second vector was the passage and signing of the "One Big, Beautiful Bill Act" on July 4, 2025\.3 This omnibus legislation, framed as tax relief, functions as a powerful tool for systemic domestic restructuring. Its provisions enact deep, long-term cuts to social safety nets, education, and environmental programs, while massively increasing funding for border enforcement and defense.3 This legislative action serves to weaken domestic resilience and institutional stability, key prerequisites for the Minimisation Plan's long-term goals.

The third vector was a sustained campaign of anomalous domestic interventions, executed through a barrage of executive orders targeting a wide array of institutions and norms previously considered outside the realm of partisan conflict.6 These actions, ranging from the defunding of public broadcasting to direct attacks on specific universities and law firms, create a climate of chaos and fear, overwhelming and paralyzing institutional opposition.7

When analyzed through the "Framework for the Judgment of Ideas," these actions consistently register as "Greater Lies".9 Their publicly stated goals—fair trade, tax relief, and good governance—serve as a "Cover" for their "True Intent": the systemic dismantling of domestic and international order. The trajectory of this agenda continues its "Regression & Fall from Grace," pushing the system further toward the Minimiser objective of a global power vacuum.

## **I. The "TACO Trade" Anomaly: Weaponized Unpredictability (April \- July 2025\)**

Following the initial shock of the "Liberation Day" tariff announcements in early April 2025, the administration's trade policy entered a new, seemingly chaotic phase. This period was defined by a pattern of escalating threats followed by sudden, unexplained de-escalations, delays, and walk-backs. This behavior quickly gave rise to a market phenomenon and viral meme known as the "TACO Trade," an acronym for "Trump Always Chickens Out".1 While on the surface this pattern suggests indecisiveness or policy failure, a deeper analysis reveals it as a deliberate and effective Minimiser tactic of weaponized unpredictability, designed to erode trust and induce strategic exhaustion in the global economic system.

### **1.1 The Birth of the "TACO" Narrative**

The "TACO" acronym was reportedly coined by *Financial Times* columnist Robert Armstrong to describe the administration's emerging pattern on trade policy.11 After the extreme tariff hikes announced on April 2nd and the subsequent market crash, the administration began a series of reversals.1 The cumulative tariff rate on Chinese goods, which had reached 145%, was abruptly reduced to 30% in a May 12 agreement.10 A planned 50% tariff on EU goods was delayed from June 1 to July 9, and then delayed again.10 The President established a 90-day pause on new tariffs and set a new deadline of August 1, 2025, for all "reciprocal" tariffs to take effect, a deadline he insisted would not be extended.1

This cycle of threat-and-retreat became so predictable that investors began to "lean into the so-called 'TACO' trade — a bet that economic reality would temper the rhetoric".1 The term quickly went viral, spawning countless internet memes and becoming a mainstream descriptor of the administration's negotiating style.10 The President himself reacted angrily to the term in a May 28 press briefing, calling it a "nasty question" and insisting, "I don't chicken out".10

### **1.2 Unpredictability as a Strategic Weapon**

The "TACO" phenomenon is not a sign of a weak or failing strategy; it is the strategy itself. The Minimisation Plan seeks to dismantle the "arborescent" world order, which is built on predictability, trust, and established rules.17 By creating an environment of radical uncertainty, the administration effectively paralyzes the global economic system. Allies, adversaries, and multinational corporations cannot make long-term plans when the foundational rules of trade can be rewritten and then erased by a single social media post.

This tactic serves multiple Minimiser objectives simultaneously:

* **Erosion of U.S. Credibility:** The constant flip-flopping erodes the credibility of the United States as a reliable partner and guarantor of the global system. As one analyst noted, "The pattern is familiar: dramatic declarations, walk-backs, and renewed threats. It's eroded his credibility and resembles the boy who cried wolf".2  
* **Inducement of Strategic Exhaustion:** The uncertainty forces other nations and corporations into a constant state of crisis management, diverting resources away from productive investment and toward contingency planning. This wait-and-see approach becomes the dominant global strategy, slowing economic growth and fostering instability.13  
* **Creation of a Deceptive Narrative:** The President masterfully spins these reversals as acts of magnanimous negotiation.13 The initial extreme threat (e.g., 145% tariffs) makes the eventual, still-high tariff rate (e.g., 30%) seem like a reasonable compromise, allowing the administration to claim a political victory while still achieving its disruptive goals.

This entire sequence maps perfectly onto the "Satan Archetype" deception model.9 The "Bait" is the protection of American industry. The "Cover" is the image of a tough, unpredictable negotiator who keeps adversaries off-balance. The "True Intent," however, is not to win a trade war but to make the concept of a stable, rules-based trade system impossible. The goal is not a better deal, but the destruction of the system that makes deals possible.

## **II. Legislative Restructuring: The "One Big, Beautiful Bill Act" (July 2025\)**

On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law the "One Big, Beautiful Bill Act" (OBBBA), a sweeping piece of omnibus legislation that represents the most significant domestic policy achievement of his second term.3 Framed publicly as a package of tax cuts for working families, the OBBBA is, in reality, a legislative Trojan horse designed to enact a fundamental and permanent restructuring of the American social contract and the financial underpinnings of the federal government. Its provisions align perfectly with the Minimiser objective of weakening domestic institutions and social cohesion, thereby reducing the state's resilience to future shocks.

### **2.1 Key Provisions of the OBBBA**

The OBBBA contains hundreds of provisions, but its strategic core can be understood through several key areas 3:

* **Tax Restructuring:** The act makes the 2017 individual tax cuts permanent and introduces new, temporary deductions (effective 2025-2028) for tipped income, overtime pay, and interest on loans for U.S.-assembled cars.3 It also creates "Trump Accounts," a new type of tax-deferred savings vehicle for parents.3 While framed as middle-class relief, these provisions are paired with a permanent repeal of the personal exemption and a permanent extension of the 37% top individual tax rate.19  
* **Social Safety Net Retrenchment:** The legislation enacts a significant 12% cut to Medicaid spending and expands work requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), making states partially responsible for program costs if their payment error rates are too high.3 It also limits Medicaid eligibility for certain classes of noncitizens and freezes state provider taxes at current levels, restricting a key mechanism states use to fund their share of the program.5  
* **Education and Student Loan Overhaul:** The act eliminates the Direct PLUS loan program for graduate students, replacing it with a capped loan structure that dramatically limits borrowing capacity for postgraduate education.21 This is expected to severely curtail access to graduate school for lower- and middle-income students.21  
* **Ideological Spending Priorities:** The OBBBA includes $150 billion in new defense spending and another $150 billion for border enforcement and deportations. This transforms Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) into the single most-funded law enforcement agency in the federal government.3 Concurrently, the act phases out clean energy tax credits from the previous administration's Inflation Reduction Act, promoting fossil fuels over renewable energy.3

### **2.2 The OBBBA as a Tool of Systemic Erosion**

When analyzed through the "Framework for the Judgment of Ideas," the OBBBA is a clear "Greater Lie".9 The "Cover" is a populist narrative of tax cuts for waitresses, auto workers, and seniors. The "True Intent," however, is a long-term project of systemic erosion.

The act's provisions work in concert to achieve core Minimiser goals:

* **Weakening Social Cohesion:** By cutting programs like Medicaid and SNAP while providing temporary and targeted tax relief, the bill exacerbates economic inequality and weakens the social safety net that mitigates social unrest during times of economic stress.  
* **Undermining Future Competitiveness:** Limiting access to graduate education and eliminating incentives for green energy development are direct attacks on the country's long-term scientific and economic competitiveness.  
* **Enforcing a Nationalist Ideology:** The massive reallocation of funds from social programs to border enforcement and deportation is a clear legislative codification of the administration's "America First" ideology, prioritizing exclusion over domestic welfare.

The OBBBA is a more insidious and permanent tool than an executive order. By enshrining these changes in statute, the administration makes them far more difficult for future administrations to reverse. It is a legislative monument to the Minimisation Plan's goal of creating a weaker, more divided, and less resilient state, less capable of projecting power abroad or maintaining stability at home.

## **III. The Campaign of Anomalous Domestic Interventions (January \- September 2025\)**

Concurrent with its major foreign policy and legislative initiatives, the administration unleashed a sustained campaign of anomalous domestic actions. Executed through a record-breaking number of executive orders and agency directives, this campaign targeted a diverse array of institutions, norms, and social constructs, creating a "hum" of illogicality and strategic chaos.6 This multi-front assault was not a series of disconnected whims but a coherent strategy designed to induce domestic strategic exhaustion, overwhelming the capacity of civil society, the courts, and political opponents to mount an effective resistance.

### **3.1 A Multi-Front Assault on Institutions and Norms**

The campaign of interventions was characterized by its sheer breadth and unprecedented nature. Key targets included:

* **The Educational and Cultural Sectors:** The administration moved to dismantle the Department of Education via executive order.8 It targeted specific universities, with a proclamation restricting entry for foreign nationals seeking to study at Harvard University.8 It also launched investigations into public broadcasters PBS and NPR and passed legislation that rescinded future funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.7  
* **The Legal and Justice System:** An executive order barred all federal agencies from using the services of the law firm Perkins Coie.8 The administration declared a state of emergency in Washington, D.C., seizing operational control of the city's police force from the mayor.24 It also issued pardons for all individuals convicted of offenses related to the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot.25  
* **Social and Scientific Constructs:** A flurry of executive orders sought to redefine fundamental concepts in federal law. One order declared that sex is strictly binary (male or female) and stripped gender identity from all federal policies, banning transgender people from military service.24 Another aimed to eradicate "Anti-Christian Bias," while others promoted "classical architecture" as the default for federal buildings and directed the prosecution of flag burning.25  
* **Federal Governance and Emergency Powers:** The administration shifted the costs of FEMA disaster response to the states.23 It also initiated a review of "unidentified anomalous phenomenon" (UAP) material, signaling a willingness to engage with fringe topics to maintain public attention and sow confusion.27

### **3.2 Domestic Strategic Exhaustion as the Objective**

This relentless, multi-front assault serves the same purpose domestically as the "NATO Gambit" did internationally: to induce strategic exhaustion. By attacking the media, academia, the legal profession, cultural norms, and the basic functions of government simultaneously, the administration creates a state of perpetual crisis.

Each individual action, when viewed in isolation, may seem bizarre or relatively minor. However, their cumulative effect is to overwhelm the system's defenses. Advocacy groups, legal organizations, and political opponents are forced into a reactive, triaging posture, unable to focus their resources on any single front. This generates a chilling effect across civil society, as institutions become fearful of being the next target.6 The ultimate goal is to paralyze opposition and normalize a state of chaos in which the executive can act with impunity, a key step in the degradation of democratic institutions and the consolidation of power required by the Minimisation Plan.
