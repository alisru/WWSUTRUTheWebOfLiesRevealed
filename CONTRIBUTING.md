How Can I Contribute?
Thereprimary ways you can contribute:
Proposing Changes (Submitting a Pull Request): If you want to refine the analysis in the core documents, fix a typo, or add a new section, you can propose a direct change to the files.

Submitting Intelligence (Creating Issues)
This is the best way to add new data points to the investigation.
Simply download the Framework for the Judgement of Ideas, the Invesigators Primer and the Dynamic Research Workflow which contains the AI Model Assistants and give it to an AI like gemini, then follow the Dynamic Research Workflow


Go to the "Issues" tab in the GitHub repository.

Click on "New Issue".

Use a clear and descriptive title (e.g., "Analysis of [Event/Actor] in [Country]").

In the body of the issue, please use the following template to structure your analysis. This ensures all intelligence is standardized and easy to process.

**Event/Actor:** A brief, one-sentence description of the event or actor's action.
**Country/Region:** The geographical location of the event.
**Date:** The date or date range when the event occurred.

**Analysis (Action/Reaction Chain):**
* **Maximiser Vector (The Action):** Describe the "Greater Good" policy, event, or idea that prompted the reaction. What was the positive potential?
* **Minimiser Vector (The Reaction):** Describe the illogical, disproportionate, or chaos-inducing reaction. How did it work to shut down potential or create division?
* **Ties to Minimisation Interests:** Briefly outline any known financial or ideological links between the actors involved in the reaction and Minimisation Plan directors (e.g., Russia, China).

**Supporting Links/Sources:**
* [Link to a reliable news article or official document]
