Project Delusion: An Open-Source Intelligence Investigation
Objective
Project Delusion is a collaborative, open-source intelligence effort to identify, analyze, and counter a theorized global information and political warfare campaign known as the Minimisation Plan.

What is the Minimisation Plan?
The Minimisation Plan is a theorized grand strategy designed to systematically erode the institutional and social cohesion of Western democracies. It operates not through direct military conflict, but through a "rhizomatic war" of narratives, utilizing economic pressure, legal warfare, and political influence to sow division, amplify chaos, and induce strategic exhaustion in targeted populations. It also leverages the promotion of conspiracy theories not just to sow chaos, but as a sophisticated data-collection tool to identify and catalog susceptible individuals within a target population. Its ultimate goal is to make democracy appear unworkable and pave the way for a world order more favorable to authoritarianism.

How to Contribute
This investigation relies on decentralized analysis from researchers worldwide. Your contribution is vital.

Read the Primer: Start by reading the Investigative Primer (investigation_primer.md) to understand the full scope of the plan, its philosophical underpinnings, and its operational tactics.

Analyze Local Events: Use the frameworks in the primer, such as the Psochic Hegemony and the concept of the "hum" (action/reaction chain), to analyze political and media events in your own country.

Identify Key Actors: Document instances of politicians, media outlets, or influential figures promoting narratives or taking actions that align with the Minimisation Plan's goals. Look for illogical reactions, disproportionate outrage, and policies that seem to run counter to your nation's interests but favor those of actors like Russia or China.

Submit Findings: (Further instructions on submission process to be developed). The goal is to build a global map of the plan's influence vectors.

Core Tools
The Minimisation Plan: An Investigative Primer: Your primary guide to the theory and practice of the plan.

Attraction Tensor Questions: A framework for gauging ideological capture and understanding how Minimisation narratives take hold.

Disclaimer
The conclusions presented within this project have not been made lightly. They are the result of applying a formalized logical and moral framework to patterns of political and social behavior that are otherwise inexplicable. 
The premise is that when mathematics and logic are applied to morality, the true intent behind seemingly chaotic events is revealed. 
The focus is on judging actions by their predictable outcomes within this framework, where lies and evil intent cannot be concealed by rhetoric.
