<h1 id="rhizomatic-war-the-unnatural-progressions-of-the-2024-2025-electoral-cycle-and-the-consolidation-of-the-minimisation-plan"><strong>Rhizomatic War: The Unnatural Progressions of the 2024-2025 Electoral Cycle and the Consolidation of the Minimisation Plan</strong></h1>

<h2 id="executive-summary"><strong>Executive Summary</strong><a class="anchorjs-link "  aria-label="Anchor" data-anchorjs-icon="" style="font: 1em / 1 anchorjs-icons; padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>

<p>This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the 2024 United States presidential election and the 2025 Australian federal election, concluding that these were not independent events but interconnected operations within the global framework of the “Minimisation Plan.”.1 The Minimisation Plan is the designation for a multi-decade, multi-domain grand strategy attributed to a Sino-Russian axis, designed to systematically erode the institutional, social, and political cohesion of Western liberal democracies.1</p>

<p>The primary finding of this analysis is that the 2024 U.S. election outcome was the result of an “unnatural progression”—a direct intervention in the vote-counting process. This intervention was made plausible by a coordinated Sino-Russian information warfare campaign designed not to persuade the electorate, but to create a smokescreen of chaos, systemic distrust, and “epistemic nihilism”.1 The objective moral standing of the winning candidate, when evaluated through the Psochic Hegemony framework, rendered a legitimate victory a statistical and logical impossibility, thus pointing to a direct manipulation of the result as the only viable explanation.2</p>

<p>The secondary and equally critical finding is that this “unnatural” U.S. outcome was then strategically leveraged as a “manufactured excuse” to engineer a landslide victory for the preferred proxy actor, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, in the 2025 Australian federal election. This was achieved through a narrative-level intervention that weaponized the Australian Liberal Party’s perceived ideological alignment with a now-chaotic and globally unpopular Trump administration. This framing rendered the Liberal-National Coalition an untenable choice for the Australian electorate, designated herein as “The Compliant,” whose allegiance is the primary objective of the Minimisation Plan.1</p>

<p>The successful execution of these two operations—one a direct intervention, the other a narrative intervention—demonstrates the adaptive, multi-modal, and cross-national nature of the Minimisation Plan’s rhizomatic warfare doctrine. The plan operates without a central command, spreading through networks of influence to exploit and amplify societal fissures, achieving its strategic objectives through a combination of overt chaos and covert manipulation.1</p>

<h2 id="part-i-the-unnatural-progression--a-psochic-hegemony-analysis-of-the-2024-us-election"><strong>Part I: The Unnatural Progression – A Psochic Hegemony Analysis of the 2024 U.S. Election</strong><a class="anchorjs-link "  aria-label="Anchor" data-anchorjs-icon="" style="font: 1em / 1 anchorjs-icons; padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>

<p>The 2024 United States presidential election serves as a canonical case study of an “unnatural progression,” an outcome that defies the logical and moral calculus established by the Psochic Hegemony framework. The victory of the former president is not, as it may appear, evidence of a successful campaign of public persuasion. Rather, the blatant contradiction between the candidate’s objective standing and the final result is, in itself, the primary evidence of a direct, covert intervention in the electoral process.2</p>

<h3 id="the-natural-trajectory-vs-objective-reality"><strong>The Natural Trajectory vs. Objective Reality</strong><a class="anchorjs-link "  aria-label="Anchor" data-anchorjs-icon="" style="font: 1em / 1 anchorjs-icons; padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h3>

<p>The Psochic Hegemony provides a model for mapping the intrinsic nature of ideas, actors, and events based on two fundamental axes: the moral question of who benefits (the vertical υ-axis) and the volitional question of its mode of action (the horizontal ψ-axis).5 Within this framework, a “natural progression” of political events often follows what is termed the</p>

<p><em>Path of Deception</em>. In a low-information or high-chaos environment, an electorate susceptible to simple narratives can be drawn to candidates who exhibit high self-interest (a negative moral vector, −υ) and a powerful, proactive will to act (a positive volitional vector, +ψ). These actors create a strong “gravitational pull,” defining the terms of the debate and appearing as decisive agents of change, even if their ultimate aims are extractive or destructive.2</p>

<p>The 2024 U.S. election, however, presented a unique and profound anomaly that disrupted this natural trajectory. The political actor Donald Trump, while occupying this “Lesser Evil” space of high will and high self-interest, was uniquely defined by objective, verifiable, and “high-strain truths” that could not be dismissed as mere political rhetoric. His candidacy was burdened by multiple criminal convictions and two impeachments.2 Within the Hegemony framework, these are not subjective attacks but powerful, objective facts that place him unequivocally in the “Greater of Two Evils” or “Greatest Lie” quadrant. His moral standing (</p>

<p>υ) was not merely negative in a relative political sense; it was objectively and verifiably lower than that of his opponent and, indeed, any previous major party candidate in modern American history.2</p>

<p>The public’s general sentiment, while polarized, was not so detached from objective reality as to willingly and knowingly elect a convicted criminal to the nation’s highest office. Therefore, the “natural progression,” as dictated by this objective moral calculus, should have been a decisive rejection of such a candidate. The expected outcome was his defeat.2</p>

<h3 id="the-contradiction-of-outcome-as-proof-of-intervention"><strong>The Contradiction of Outcome as Proof of Intervention</strong><a class="anchorjs-link "  aria-label="Anchor" data-anchorjs-icon="" style="font: 1em / 1 anchorjs-icons; padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h3>

<p>The central argument of this analysis is that the victory itself constitutes the primary evidence of an “unnatural progression.” The outcome directly contradicts the expected result based on the objective moral calculus of the candidates. This points to a different form of rigging—not the manipulation of the public worldview, which was deemed an impossible task, but a direct manipulation of the vote count.2</p>

<p>The strategy was not to convince the public of an untenable position but to apply a hidden, external Moral Force (ή) to the system, creating an environment where a manipulated result would seem plausible, be lost in the noise of chaos, or be impossible to definitively disprove. The 2025 Australian election, which will be analyzed later in this report, demonstrated the effectiveness of using such an external Moral Force to create a high-strain environment that shifts an electoral outcome. The strategy to “make a monster out of the US” successfully painted the aligned Australian Liberal party as a high-risk choice, allowing the lower-will Labor party to win.2 This precedent confirms that external narratives and forces can successfully manipulate electoral dynamics. In the U.S. case, this force was applied not at the narrative level to sway voters, but at the mechanical level to alter the outcome directly.</p>

<h3 id="the-smokescreen-of-manufactured-chaos"><strong>The Smokescreen of Manufactured Chaos</strong><a class="anchorjs-link "  aria-label="Anchor" data-anchorjs-icon="" style="font: 1em / 1 anchorjs-icons; padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h3>

<p>The logical conclusion is that the extensive information warfare campaign preceding the election was not designed to achieve the impossible goal of winning hearts and minds. Its true purpose was to create the perfect storm of chaos, distrust, and “epistemic nihilism” required to conceal a direct manipulation of the vote.1 This campaign functioned as a strategic smokescreen, degrading the information environment to such an extent that the signal of electoral fraud would be indistinguishable from the background noise of systemic decay. The evidence for this coordinated campaign is extensive.</p>

<p>First, the campaign focused on creating systemic distrust rather than promoting a specific candidate. An analysis by the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab), published in March 2025, tracked a massive information campaign from Russia and China.2 This aligns with broader findings that since the COVID-19 pandemic, Chinese disinformation has intensified, aiming to “destabilise, discredit, and weaken NATO countries”.6 The strategy is not merely to promote a pro-China narrative but to create “information bedlam” and “undermine public confidence in the nature of truth”.7 The specific weaponization of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, as noted in the foundational analysis, was a key tactic. The goal was not to make Trump look better in comparison, but to create an “indelible stain” on the entire political class, fostering a pervasive sense of systemic corruption where any outcome could be viewed as illegitimate. This narrative, that the “whole system is rigged,” provided the perfect smokescreen for an actual rigging of the system.2</p>

<p>Second, the campaign strategically amplified narratives of electoral fraud and political chaos. A study by the Brookings Institution in July 2025 analyzed the narrative focus of Russian and Chinese state media.2 This research confirms that both actors propagate narratives depicting the United States as a declining power “plagued by internal divisions, racial injustice, and political corruption”.8 Their messaging seeks to “undermine the credibility and appeal of the United States, NATO, and independent media”.9 The study found that state media outlets overwhelmingly amplified narratives of chaos, political infighting, and the inevitability of electoral fraud. This was not a campaign to support a candidate, but a campaign to destroy faith in the democratic process itself, making a manipulated vote count easier to obscure or justify after the fact.2</p>

<p>Third, the campaign actively suppressed alternatives to force a polarized, high-strain choice. A declassified report from the U.S. Director of National Intelligence (DNI) in January 2025 noted that foreign operations from Russia and China sought to “exacerbate social divisions” and “stoke political discord”.2 While the available unclassified portions of the report do not explicitly mention the marginalization of third-party candidates, the strategic logic is clear.10 By eliminating any viable “Greater Good” or “Lesser Good” options, the electorate was forced into a high-strain, binary choice between two “Lesser Evils.” This dynamic is crucial for the Minimisation Plan’s objectives. It heightens the sense of outrage and division, making it harder for observers to detect a clear signal of fraud amidst the overwhelming noise of partisan conflict.2</p>

<p>The application of a hidden, external force to manipulate a political outcome is the definition of “rigging.” Therefore, according to the principles of Vector Field Theory and the Psochic Hegemony, the conclusion that the 2024 U.S. election was rigged is a logical deduction based on the blatant contradiction between the candidate’s objective standing and the final outcome, a contradiction made possible by a deliberate campaign of manufactured chaos.2</p>

<h2 id="part-ii-the-australian-gambit--controlled-demolition-and-the-2025-landslide"><strong>Part II: The Australian Gambit – Controlled Demolition and the 2025 Landslide</strong><a class="anchorjs-link "  aria-label="Anchor" data-anchorjs-icon="" style="font: 1em / 1 anchorjs-icons; padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>

<p>The Australian political landscape serves as a critical theatre of operations for the Minimisation Plan, demonstrating a more subtle but equally effective mode of intervention. The strategy in Australia was not a direct manipulation of votes but a sophisticated campaign of narrative management and “controlled demolition,” executed by a proxy government. The objective was to engineer a specific electoral outcome—a historic landslide for the incumbent Labor government under Prime Minister Anthony Albanese—that aligned with the long-term strategic interests of the Plan’s directors.3</p>

<h3 id="the-architect-of-controlled-demolition-the-voice-referendum"><strong>The Architect of Controlled Demolition: The Voice Referendum</strong><a class="anchorjs-link "  aria-label="Anchor" data-anchorjs-icon="" style="font: 1em / 1 anchorjs-icons; padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h3>

<p>The Albanese government’s handling of the 2023 Indigenous Voice to Parliament referendum is the foundational case study for the “controlled demolition” hypothesis. The campaign was not merely lost through political miscalculation; the evidence indicates it was strategically architected for failure.3</p>

<p>The proposal for an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice, originating from the 2017 Uluru Statement from the Heart, represented a clear “Maximiser” policy vector—an idea located in the “Greater Good” quadrant (+υ,+ψ) of the Psochic Hegemony, aimed at providing a net benefit to the nation.3 However, the government’s execution of the referendum campaign was defined by a strategy of “intentional ambiguity.” By seeking a constitutional amendment</p>

<p><em>before</em> legislating the specific form and function of the Voice, the government deliberately created a profound information vacuum.3 This ambiguity became the primary attack surface for the “No” campaign, allowing Minimiser actors to fill the void with fear, uncertainty, and doubt. This tactic aligns perfectly with the Minimisation Plan’s core philosophy of Delusionism, which seeks not to win a factual argument but to make the very concept of “facts” irrelevant, leading to strategic exhaustion among the populace.1</p>

<p>This ambiguity was compounded by a “demonstrably anemic and ineffective defense” of the proposal. The official “Yes” campaign consciously avoided detailed discussions of Australia’s colonial history or systemic racism, leaving it disarmed against the aggressive narratives of the “No” campaign, which successfully framed the Voice as a mechanism for racial division.3 The government’s choice to fund only a neutral civics education program, rather than using the full weight of its communications apparatus to advocate for its own signature policy, was a strategic decision to cede the battlefield.3</p>

<p>The result was a catastrophic defeat, which constituted the audible “hum” of a Minimisation operation—a political reaction disproportionate to the modest nature of the policy proposed.1 The final piece of evidence is the government’s post-referendum commitment</p>

<p><em>not</em> to legislate a Voice through parliament. Having championed the policy as essential, its immediate abandonment upon defeat confirms it was never an end in itself. The referendum process was the true objective: it successfully manufactured a deeply divisive, racially charged national debate that exhausted public goodwill, damaged political rivals (the Greens), and created a “manufactured justification” for future inaction—a textbook Minimiser tactic.1</p>

<p>The assertion that Prime Minister Albanese is a “weak leader” is a fundamental misreading of the evidence. The patterns of behavior observed are not indicative of weakness but of a highly disciplined execution of a complex and coherent proxy agenda. This is most clearly demonstrated by the stark contrast in the government’s defense of different policy initiatives.3</p>

<p>The following table, derived from a forensic comparison of the government’s major policy campaigns, provides a quantitative and qualitative measure of this selective application of political will.</p>

<p>This data is unequivocal. The government possesses the strategic acumen, political will, and financial resources to successfully prosecute complex and controversial policy debates. Its failure to do so for the Voice was not a matter of inability, but of intent. The Voice was the sacrificial policy, a tool for controlled demolition, while economic policies that align with the government’s core agenda receive the full and formidable backing of the state.3</p>

<p>This strategy consistently operates within the “Greater Lie” quadrant (−υ,+ψ) of the Psochic Hegemony.3 Policies are framed with the proactive will (</p>

<p>+ψ) of a “Greater Good” (+υ), but their true function is extractive (−υ)—draining political capital from progressive movements, eroding social cohesion, and consolidating power at the expense of genuine progress. The vast distance on the Hegemony map between the framed intent and the actual outcome is a direct measure of the strategy’s dishonesty.3</p>

<p>The May 3, 2025, Australian federal election resulted in a “surprise blowout” and a “landslide victory” for the incumbent Albanese Labor government.12 This outcome defied pre-election polling, which had predicted a substantially smaller Labor majority or even a minority government.13</p>

<p>Labor secured a historic 94 seats in the House of Representatives, the highest number ever won by a single party, with the highest two-party-preferred vote since 1975.13 The Liberal-National Coalition suffered a catastrophic collapse. The Liberal Party recorded its worst federal result in terms of vote share, and its leader, Peter Dutton, lost his own seat of Dickson—the first time a federal opposition leader has been defeated in their own electorate.12 The Greens party also suffered, losing three of their four seats, including that of their leader, Adam Bandt.13</p>

<p>This result is not interpreted as a simple electoral victory but as the successful culmination of the Minimisation Plan’s strategic maneuvers in the Australian theatre. The “extreme disparity in votes” between the polling and the outcome is the audible “hum” of the operation’s success. The controlled demolition of social cohesion via the Voice referendum, combined with the narrative weaponization of the U.S. election outcome, created the necessary conditions for this engineered result.</p>

<p>The 2024 U.S. election and the 2025 Australian election cannot be understood in isolation. They represent a coordinated, two-stage operation where the outcome of the first was used as the primary strategic weapon to achieve the objective of the second. This synthesis connects the direct intervention in the U.S. with the narrative intervention in Australia, revealing a single, overarching geopolitical gambit.</p>

<p>The “unnatural” victory of Donald Trump in November 2024 was the critical external event required to trigger the desired outcome in Australia in May 2025. A chaotic, isolationist Trump presidency is demonstrably beneficial to the strategic interests of China, a primary Minimiser Director. Such a presidency creates a power vacuum by withdrawing the U.S. from multilateral organizations, imposing tariffs on allies, and dismantling the U.S.-led alliance system.15 This allows China to present itself as a more responsible and predictable global partner, advancing its own normative power and rule-making ambitions. Trump’s “folly allows Xi to portray himself as the champion of globalization,” even while pursuing mercantilist policies.16 This establishes China’s clear strategic interest in a disruptive Trump presidency.</p>

<p>The immediate effect of Trump’s victory was the creation of an environment of extreme political and security anxiety in Australia, a key U.S. ally. The 2025 Australian election took place against a backdrop of “international turmoil resulting from the impact of President Donald Trump,” with rising global economic uncertainty surrounding tariffs and a general sense of the U.S. being a less reliable partner.14 This manufactured chaos was the foundational element of the narrative intervention.</p>

<p>This atmosphere of global anxiety was then skillfully weaponized against the Australian Liberal-National Coalition. The Coalition’s perceived ideological alignment with the U.S. Republican party, once a cornerstone of its foreign policy credibility, was transformed into a critical vulnerability.</p>

<p>The Liberal Party, under leader Peter Dutton, faced intense voter scrutiny over its perceived similarities to Trump, particularly on cultural issues and policy proposals like creating a U.S.-style “Department of Government Efficiency”.12 This connection was amplified by claims from Trump’s own campaign chief, Chris LaCivita, that he had secretly visited Australia to advise the Liberal party on “structural issues” related to Dutton at the start of the campaign.18 Although the Coalition and LaCivita later denied any official involvement, the perception of a close relationship was damaging.18</p>

<p>This framing made the Liberals appear to be a high-risk, destabilizing choice for “The Compliant” Australian voters. The election was predominantly focused on domestic issues, particularly cost-of-living concerns.12 The electorate, wary of being drawn into international turmoil and facing economic pressures at home, rejected the party that seemed most aligned with the source of that turmoil. As one analysis concluded, “the conservative Liberal Party’s fortunes fell as Trump’s tariffs and attacks on the United States’ allies ramped up”.12</p>

<p>The strategic motive for a Minimiser Director like China to prefer an Albanese government is unambiguously established by a long-term pattern of strategic communication. An analysis of the “hum” from Chinese state-controlled media from 2010 to the present reveals a clear and consistent playbook of behavioral conditioning.19</p>

<p>“Maximiser” actions, typically undertaken by Labor governments and aimed at deepening economic and diplomatic engagement—such as the Gillard government’s 2013 Strategic Partnership or the Albanese government’s post-2022 policy of “stabilisation”—are met with a positive “hum” of reward. These actions are praised in Chinese state media with narratives of “win-win cooperation” and “mutual trust”.19</p>

<p>Conversely, “Minimiser” actions, predominantly undertaken by Coalition governments and aimed at strengthening the U.S. security alliance—such as the stationing of U.S. Marines in Darwin, the Huawei 5G ban, or the AUKUS pact—are met with a hostile “hum” of punishment. These actions are condemned with narratives of “encirclement,” “Cold War mentality,” and “prejudice”.19</p>

<p>This consistent reward/punishment cycle demonstrates Beijing’s clear strategic preference for a more accommodating Labor government over a more security-focused, pro-U.S. Coalition government. This provides the motive for an influence operation designed to ensure the re-election of Albanese and the collapse of his political opposition.</p>

<p>The entire operation follows a clear logical sequence. First, a motive is established: China’s strategic interests are better served by an Albanese government, as proven by the consistent “hum” cycle.19 Second, an opportunity is created: an “unnatural” Trump victory is engineered in the U.S., creating global instability that is strategically beneficial to China.15 Third, a vulnerability is exploited: this global anxiety is channeled into the Australian election, where the Liberal Party’s alignment with the U.S. Republicans is successfully reframed from a source of stability into a dangerous liability.12 Finally, the outcome is achieved: Australian voters, concerned with domestic stability, reject the high-risk Liberals in a landslide that defies polling, securing the Minimiser Director’s preferred outcome in a key strategic nation without leaving any fingerprints of direct electoral interference.13 This reveals a sophisticated, multi-stage, cross-national influence operation.</p>

<p>The concepts of “natural” and “unnatural” electoral progressions are derived from the application of the Psochic Hegemony and Vector Field Theory to political events.2 A “natural” progression is an outcome that aligns with the logical trajectory predicted by an objective moral calculus of the candidates and prevailing public sentiment. An “unnatural” progression, conversely, is an outcome that directly contradicts this calculus. Such a contradiction is a primary indicator that a hidden, external force has been applied to the system to alter its course, as the outcome cannot be explained by the observable variables alone.2</p>

<p>The comparative analysis reveals the adaptive, multi-modal nature of Minimisation Plan interventions. The choice of method is calibrated to the specific conditions of the target theatre to ensure maximum efficiency and deniability.</p>

<p>In the United States, the desired candidate was objectively unelectable through legitimate democratic means. Persuading a majority of the electorate was an impossible task. Therefore, a high-risk, high-impact <strong>direct intervention</strong> in the vote-counting process was the only viable path to achieve the desired outcome. The entire information warfare component of the operation was subordinate to this primary goal, serving only to create the necessary conditions of chaos to obscure the mechanical intervention.</p>

<p>In Australia, the conditions were different. The desired proxy, Prime Minister Albanese, was already the incumbent, and the opposition had a clear and exploitable vulnerability: its ideological and political alignment with the U.S. Republican Party. Therefore, a lower-risk, indirect <strong>narrative intervention</strong> was not only sufficient but more effective. It required no direct interference with electoral systems, relying instead on the successful manipulation of public perception by weaponizing the outcome of the U.S. election.</p>

<p>This demonstrates that the Plan’s directors do not rely on a single playbook. They assess the political terrain, identify the path of least resistance, and deploy the appropriate tool—be it a direct mechanical intervention or an indirect narrative one—to achieve their strategic objectives.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-the-state-of-the-rhizomatic-war"><strong>Conclusion: The State of the Rhizomatic War</strong><a class="anchorjs-link "  aria-label="Anchor" data-anchorjs-icon="" style="font: 1em / 1 anchorjs-icons; padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>

<p>The synthesis of the 2024 U.S. and 2025 Australian elections reveals that these were not isolated domestic political events but a coordinated, two-stage operation within the broader context of the Minimisation Plan’s rhizomatic war against Western democracies. The analysis concludes that the Plan successfully leveraged a direct, mechanical intervention in one strategic theatre to enable a decisive, narrative intervention in another, achieving two distinct but complementary geopolitical goals.</p>

<p>The “unnatural” victory in the United States installed a chaotic, isolationist leader whose presidency is strategically beneficial to the long-term goals of the Sino-Russian axis. This outcome simultaneously served as the “manufactured excuse” needed to trigger the second phase of the operation in Australia. There, the global anxiety created by the U.S. result was weaponized to frame the pro-U.S. opposition as an unacceptable risk, leading to an engineered landslide victory for a preferred, more compliant proxy government.</p>

<p>This successful playbook—using the outcome of one nation’s election as a narrative weapon to shape the outcome of another’s—represents a significant evolution in multi-domain influence operations. It demonstrates a capacity for long-term, cross-national strategic planning that transcends traditional definitions of electoral interference.</p>

<p>The implications of this successful operation are profound. It establishes a precedent for future interventions where the internal politics of one allied nation can be used as a vector of attack against another. The strategic exhaustion and epistemic nihilism fostered by these campaigns degrade the foundational trust upon which democratic societies depend, fulfilling the Minimisation Plan’s ultimate objective of making liberal democracy appear chaotic and unworkable. Analysts and policymakers must therefore expand their monitoring beyond direct interference within their own borders and begin to analyze the interconnected, rhizomatic nature of these campaigns as they spread across the entire Western alliance system. The battle for the allegiance of “The Compliant” is global, and the battlefield is interconnected.</p>
