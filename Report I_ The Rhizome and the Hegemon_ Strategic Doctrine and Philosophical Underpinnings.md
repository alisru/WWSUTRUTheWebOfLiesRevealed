### **Section 1: The Philosophical Doctrine of Asymmetric Conflict**

The analysis of contemporary geopolitical conflict requires a conceptual framework capable of grasping strategies that operate not by contesting established truths, but by dissolving the very foundations of truth itself.1 The 'Minimisation Plan', a theorized multi-decade Sino-Russian grand strategy, cannot be fully understood through conventional models of statecraft, which are predicated on hierarchical power and a clear distinction between truth and falsehood.1 A more potent, if unconventional, lens is offered by the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze, whose work provides a systematic deconstruction of the foundational assumptions of Western metaphysics.4 By examining the core conflict between the Western "arborescent" model of reality and the operationalized Deleuzian "rhizomatic" doctrine, it becomes possible to map the ideological battlefield upon which this new form of warfare is waged.1

#### **1.1 The Arborescent West: A Worldview Rooted in Singular Truth**

The Western liberal order, and the geopolitical structure it supports, is fundamentally "arborescent" or "tree-like" in its conception of reality, knowledge, and power.1 This model, which Deleuze identifies as the central pillar of Western metaphysical thought since Plato, is defined by a central root—a single origin, a transcendent and unified truth—from which a trunk and a series of hierarchical, bifurcating branches logically extend.1 This structure inherently privileges unity over multiplicity, identity over difference, and the original over the copy.7 The entire apparatus of Western thought, from this perspective, is an exercise in tracing phenomena back to their authenticating origin, distinguishing "good copies" (facts) from "bad copies" (falsehoods).1

Geopolitically, the post-Cold War "unipolar order" represents a quintessential arborescent structure.1 It is predicated on a single origin of political and economic legitimacy—Washington D.C.—and a set of hierarchical institutions, such as the G7, the World Bank, and the United Nations, that branch out from and are legitimized by this central hegemonic authority.1 This worldview's greatest strength—its commitment to a singular, verifiable, "rules-based" order—is also its greatest vulnerability.1 It presupposes a shared reality in which evidence can be debated and truth can, ultimately, be ascertained.1 The Minimisation Plan is designed to attack this fundamental presupposition.1

#### **1.2 The Rhizomatic Doctrine: Weaponizing Multiplicity and the Simulacrum**

In direct opposition to the arborescent model, the Minimisation Plan appears to operate according to a "rhizomatic" logic, a concept developed by Deleuze and Félix Guattari.1 A rhizome is a subterranean, non-hierarchical network where any point can be connected to any other point without a central root or predetermined path.6 It is a model for decentralized, networked systems that operate through fluid connections and emergent properties, making it the conceptual blueprint for guerrilla warfare and for the multi-domain grand strategy of the Sino-Russian alliance.1

The philosophical engine of this doctrine is Deleuze's "reversal of Platonism," a radical denial of a unified origin or a singular, transcendent truth.1 In place of a world of copies tethered to an original, Deleuze posits a world composed of

*simulacra*.1 A simulacrum is not merely a degraded copy; it is a copy for which there is no original, an entity that asserts its own reality without reference to a higher, legitimizing model.1 Its power lies not in its veracity, but in its ability to function as a self-validating reality that produces its own real-world effects.1

The strategic objective of a rhizomatic actor, therefore, is not to replace the West's "true" narrative with a "false" one.1 Rather, the goal is to introduce a multiplicity of potent simulacra into the information ecosystem, shattering the very notion of a single, authoritative narrative.1 Narratives such as the COVID-19 lab leak hypothesis or the weaponized version of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal function as perfect simulacra.1 Their efficacy is not contingent on their empirical verifiability.1 Their power lies in their ability to generate tangible effects: eroding institutional trust, sowing social division, and paralyzing an adversary's decision-making cycle by creating a state of "unresolvable ambiguity".1 This is not simply propaganda; it is a form of metaphysical warfare aimed at dissolving the adversary's cognitive foundation.1

#### **1.3 A Timeline of Influence: From Post-’68 Paris to 21st Century Geopolitics**

The philosophical concepts that provide such a powerful lens for analyzing 21st-century conflict are not recent developments.1 They emerged from the intellectual ferment of post-war France and reached maturity decades before the alleged initiation of the 'Minimisation Plan'.1 Gilles Deleuze's foundational works,

*Difference and Repetition* (1968) and his collaborations with Félix Guattari, *Anti-Oedipus* (1972) and *A Thousand Plateaus* (1980), were mature, well-understood, and widely available in the West for at least a decade before the Minimisation Plan is said to have been initiated around 2001\.1 By the 1980s and 1990s, almost all of Deleuze's major works had been translated into English and were being widely debated within English-speaking academia.5

This temporal relationship is of critical strategic importance.1 It suggests that Deleuze's philosophy should be viewed not merely as a coincidental analytical framework applied in hindsight, but as a potential operational doctrine that could have been studied and weaponized by state actors engaged in long-term strategic planning.1 As Deleuze's entire philosophical project is a profound and systematic critique of Western liberal humanism and its reliance on a singular, transcendent truth, it provides a ready-made intellectual toolkit for deconstructing the very structures of that order.1

#### **1.4 A Critical Counterpoint to Deleuzian Doctrine**

A critical assessment of Gilles Deleuze's philosophy requires an examination of its core claims and foundational premises.7 His work is a coherent system built on a single, radical axiom: the denial of a unified origin. His concepts of the simulacrum and the rhizome all logically follow from this starting point.7

However, when evaluated against a model that begins with the opposite axiom—the existence of a unified origin—his core claims are revealed to be fundamentally incompatible.7 From a unified origin perspective, the claim that reality is composed of origin-less simulacra is a logical impossibility; all phenomena would be manifestations or "copies" of the original's dynamics.7 Similarly, the claim that reality is rhizomatic is countered by the view that while systemic interactions can appear decentralized and complex, they all ultimately trace back to the dynamics of a single "root".7 The appearance of a rhizome is an illusion created by observing the complex interactions of the "branches" without acknowledging their common origin.7 The disagreement is not over a specific fact, but over the very nature of existence. One cannot be proven right and the other wrong without first agreeing on the foundational premise of whether reality begins with a unified One or an infinite, origin-less Many.7

### **Section 2: The Forging of the Anti-Hegemonic Assemblage (2001-2021)**

The foundational phase of the Minimisation Plan, from 2001 to 2021, can be understood as the patient and deliberate construction of a geopolitical rhizome designed to challenge the West's hierarchical, arborescent order.1 This was not an attempt to supplant the American "tree" with a competing Sino-Russian tree, but rather to build a decentralized, networked "assemblage" of political, economic, and military nodes capable of de-centering, bypassing, and ultimately eroding the coherence of the established system.1 The primary psychological operation of this era was the framing of this revisionist project as a noble quest for a more equitable "multipolar" world.1

#### **2.1 Codifying Opposition and the "Multipolarity" Psyop**

The formal basis for this project was established on July 16, 2001, with the signing of the Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation between Russia and China.11 While its public articles addressed post-Soviet border demarcations and economic ties, its strategic significance was far greater, representing the first formal, post-Cold War codification of a shared strategic outlook implicitly countering the perceived unilateralism of the United States.1 Almost concurrently, this shared worldview was given its first institutional expression with the establishment of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in June 2001\.1 While its public mandate focused on counter-terrorism, its geopolitical function quickly evolved into a platform for challenging U.S. influence, culminating in the 2005 SCO summit's direct condemnation of "unipolar" policies.1

This network was expanded globally through the BRICS forum, which became the primary vehicle for the "multipolarity" psyop.1 The language consistently employed in BRICS communiques—calling for a "multipolar," "democratic, fair and rational political and economic international order"—is a sophisticated psychological operation designed to reframe revisionist ambitions as a noble quest for global equity.1 By framing their challenge as a necessary reform to make global governance more "just, equitable... and accountable," they created a narrative highly appealing to the "Global South," attracting a growing coalition of nations.1

This initial psyop exhibits the recurring strategic pattern identified as the "Satan Archetype" 3:

1. **It looks good for some people:** The narrative of multipolarity genuinely appeals to and offers greater prestige to emerging economies.3  
2. **It is given a weak cover to claim it helps everyone:** The public framing is that this movement is about creating a more fair and democratic global order for all nations, a goal that is difficult to oppose rhetorically.1  
3. **Ultimately, it is proven to only help them:** The practical outcome is the creation of a diplomatic and economic bloc that systematically provides cover for Sino-Russian actions and directly targets the foundations of Western power.3

The SCO and BRICS, therefore, are not traditional alliances but are better understood as a "legitimacy laundering" framework. By building a consensus within these non-Western forums *before* taking an aggressive geopolitical action, the alliance can frame its move as the implementation of a multilateral consensus, pre-emptively countering Western accusations of revisionism.3

### **Section 3: Methodology: The Psochic Hegemony Model**

To analyze and quantify the ideological attacks of the Minimisation Plan, this series of reports will employ the Psochic Hegemony model.3 This model provides a tool for mapping the moral and volitional character of any strategic action or narrative, calculating its potential impact on a target worldview.3 The model is represented by a two-dimensional plane.3

* **The Vertical Axis (Morality, υ):** This axis measures the beneficiary of an action. It ranges from \+υ ("To Give to Everyone") at the top, representing actions that benefit all beings, down to the origin line, which represents actions that benefit "Only Me / My Group." Below the origin, the axis extends to −υ ("To Take from Everyone"), representing actions that are fundamentally extractive.3  
* **The Horizontal Axis (Will, ψ):** This axis measures the intensity and direction of an action's enforcement. It ranges from \+ψ ("Do Ideas") on the right, representing proactive, assertive actions, to the origin line ("Do Nothing"), and extends to −ψ ("Do Not") on the left, representing actions of suppression, negation, or inaction.3

The interaction between an action and a worldview is quantified using a revised model that reflects how lies pollute and reduce a worldview's integrity. A lie is accepted when it is framed to appear within an individual's existing worldview, a process described as the "Attraction, Helxis Tensor".3

* **Moral Force (Fm​):** A vector representing a healthy worldview, set to a baseline of Fm​=(1,1).3  
* **Action Force (Fa​):** The vector of a given psyop, plotted as Fa​=(υa​,ψa​).3  
* **Effect (Ea​):** The change in the moral force if the narrative is believed, calculated as a vector addition: Fm\_new​=Fm​+Fa​.3  
* **Worldview Update:** A running score, Worldview, tracks the cumulative integrity of the target worldview, starting at 1.0. As lies are accepted, the worldview is "reduced in size as it becomes polluted." The formula is: Worldviewnew​=Worldviewold​−(0.1×Impact×Acceptance), where Impact is the magnitude of the lie and Acceptance is a function of the lie's perceived ideological distance from the current worldview.3

#### **3.1 Psochic Hegemony Analysis: The "Multipolarity" Narrative**

The "Multipolarity" narrative (Psyop \#1) is the foundational ideological attack of the Minimisation Plan.3

* **Plotting on the Hegemony:** This narrative presents itself as a "Greater Good" but its underlying purpose is to consolidate a bloc that benefits "My Group" (the Sino-Russian axis), making it fundamentally deceptive. This places it in the "Greater Lie" quadrant. A plausible plot point is Fa1​=(υ=−0.5,ψ=0.7).3  
* **Resistance and Effect Calculation:** The Resistance required is Ra1​=(0.5,−0.7). If believed, its Effect on the baseline Moral Force Fm​=(1,1) is Ea1​=(0.5,1.7). The resulting worldview is diminished in its morality but has an inflated sense of will.3  
* **Worldview Score Update:** With a high Framing Factor of 0.7, the psyop is highly accepted by the model. The initial Worldview of 1.0 is reduced by approximately 0.059. The Updated Worldview integrity becomes 0.941, indicating the first successful pollution of the target worldview.3

### **Section 4: Critical Inquiry**

The analysis of this foundational phase raises a series of critical questions regarding its structure, intent, and long-term viability 3:

* Is the rhizomatic structure of BRICS/SCO a strategic choice for flexibility, or a necessary compromise due to inherent mistrust between core members like China and India? 3  
* How does the "legitimacy laundering" function when key members (e.g., India, Brazil) diverge from the Sino-Russian line on critical issues like the Ukraine invasion? 3  
* To what extent is the appeal to the "Global South" a genuine ideological convergence versus a transactional relationship based on Chinese economic inducements? 3  
* Can a decentralized network effectively challenge a hierarchical one without eventually developing its own hierarchy, likely centered on its most powerful node (China)? 3  
* Is the de-dollarization effort a genuine threat to U.S. financial hegemony, or a defensive measure to "sanctions-proof" the bloc's economies with limited offensive capability? 1
