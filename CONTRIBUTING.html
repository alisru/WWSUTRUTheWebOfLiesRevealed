        <h1><a href="https://github.com/alisru/WWSUTRUTheWebOfLiesRevealed">How to Contribute to Operation: [What Was Swept Under The Rug Uncovered, The Web Of Lies Revealed]</a></h1>
        <p>First, thank you for considering contributing to this critical open-source intelligence effort. Every piece of analysis helps to build a clearer picture of the global information battlefield.</p>
        <p>This document provides a set of guidelines for contributing to the project. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.</p>

        <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
        <p>This project and everyone participating in it is governed by a commitment to respectful, constructive collaboration. We are here to analyze a global threat, and that requires focused, evidence-based discussion. Personal attacks, trolling, and off-topic discussions will not be tolerated.</p>

        <h2>How Can I Contribute?</h2>
        <p>The ways you can contribute:</p>
        <p><strong>Proposing Changes (Submitting a Pull Request):</strong> If you want to refine the analysis in the core documents, fix a typo, or add a new section, you can propose a direct change to the files.</p>

        <h3>Submitting Intelligence (Creating Issues)</h3>
        <p>This is the best way to add new data points to the investigation.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to the "Issues" tab in the <a href="https://github.com/alisru/WWSUTRUTheWebOfLiesRevealed/issues">GitHub repository</a>.</li>
            <li>Click on "New Issue".</li>
            <li>Use a clear and descriptive title (e.g., "Analysis of [Event/Actor] in [Country]").</li>
            <li>In the body of the issue, please use the following template to structure your analysis. This ensures all intelligence is standardized and easy to process.</li>
        </ol>

        <pre><code>**Event/Actor:** A brief, one-sentence description of the event or actor's action.
**Country/Region:** The geographical location of the event.
**Date:** The date or date range when the event occurred.

---

**Analysis (Action/Reaction Chain):**
* **Maximiser Vector (The Action):** Describe the "Greater Good" policy, event, or idea that prompted the reaction. What was the positive potential?
* **Minimiser Vector (The Reaction):** Describe the illogical, disproportionate, or chaos-inducing reaction. How did it work to shut down potential or create division?
* **Ties to Minimisation Interests:** Briefly outline any known financial or ideological links between the actors involved in the reaction and Minimisation Plan directors (e.g., Russia, China).

**Supporting Links/Sources:**
* [Link to a reliable news article or official document]
* [Link to another source if available]</code></pre>

        <h3>Proposing Changes (Pull Request Workflow)</h3>
        <p>This is the standard workflow for making changes to a project on GitHub.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/alisru/WWSUTRUTheWebOfLiesRevealed">Fork the repository</a>:</strong> Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the main repository page. This creates a personal copy of the project under your own GitHub account.</li>
            <li><strong>Clone your fork:</strong> On your local machine, run the following command, replacing &lt;YOUR-USERNAME&gt; with your GitHub username:
                <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/&lt;YOUR-USERNAME&gt;/WWSUTRUTheWebOfLiesRevealed.git</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Create a new branch:</strong> It's important to create a new branch for each set of changes you make. This keeps your work organized. Give it a descriptive name.
                <pre><code>git checkout -b your-descriptive-branch-name</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Make your changes:</strong> Open the files in your preferred text editor and make your proposed changes. For example, you might add a new case study to the <code>investigation_primer.md</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Commit your changes:</strong> Save your changes with a clear and concise commit message that describes what you've done.
                <pre><code>git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add new case study on the 202X [Country] election"</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Push to your fork:</strong> Upload your changes to your personal fork on GitHub.
                <pre><code>git push origin your-descriptive-branch-name</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Open a Pull Request:</strong> Go to your fork on the GitHub website. You should see a prompt to "Compare &amp; pull request." Click it. This will take you to a page where you can open a pull request to merge your changes into the main project repository. Please provide a clear title and a brief description of your proposed changes.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once you've submitted your pull request, the project maintainers will review it, and a discussion may follow. Thank you for helping to uncover the web of lies.</p>
