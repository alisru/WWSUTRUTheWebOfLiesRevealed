                        What happens when these laws are extrapolated from individuals to the groups they form? The same principles apply. Powerful groups—corporations, political parties, and nation-states—will use manufactured justifications and psychological projection to trick less powerful groups into surrendering their power, wealth, and autonomy. Over time, the most effective tactics for this deception have evolved and become embedded in our global systems, creating a predictable, emergent order.

When faced with irrefutable proof, they invariably choose hostility, resorting to desperate attacks that shatter their own credibility. This breaks the spell of cynicism and leads to the great realization: The Compliant majority, who naturally want to be Maximisers, have been convinced they are powerless, when in fact they can easily, rapidly, and bloodlessly reclaim control from a fractured and fundamentally self-serving Minimiser elite.</p>
