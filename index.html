                            <strong>Selfish people will say or do anything to get what they want, and then create a justification for it.</strong> This is the primary weapon used in the trickery of Law 1. A manufactured justification, which sounds plausible but lacks evidence, is the tool of choice for any group acting in bad faith.

                            <strong>A corrupt actor can only conceive of corrupt motives.</strong> To them, a genuine concept like "everyone working together peacefully" sounds impossible and naive. Paradoxically, they know their own selfish plans are wrong and will anger the public. So, they accuse their opponents of the very evils they themselves are planning. Their accusations are a confession; they are the only tactics they themselves would find believable.

                        What happens when these laws are extrapolated from individuals to the groups they form? The same principles apply. Powerful groups—corporations, political parties, and nation-states—will use manufactured justifications and psychological projection to trick less powerful groups into surrendering their power, wealth, and autonomy. Over time, the most effective tactics for this deception have evolved and become embedded in our global systems, creating a predictable, emergent order.

                        <p>The most effective strategy for tricking a population into surrendering power is to convince them that power is meaningless. The Minimiser promotes a <span class="text-white font-semibold">"manufactured narrative of decay"</span>—the idea that all systems are broken, all leaders are corrupt, and all efforts to change things are futile. Their goal is to foster a cynical apathy that makes people give up without a fight.</p>

By presenting better, verifiable alternatives that serve the public good, Maximisers force the Minimisers into a dilemma: either shut up and play along, or fight back with open hostility. When faced with irrefutable proof, they invariably choose hostility, resorting to desperate attacks that shatter their own credibility. This breaks the spell of cynicism and leads to the great realization: The Compliant majority, who naturally want to be Maximisers, have been convinced they are powerless, when in fact they can easily, rapidly, and bloodlessly reclaim control from a fractured and fundamentally self-serving Minimiser elite.</p>
