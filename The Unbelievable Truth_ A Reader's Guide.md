## **The Unbelievable Truth: A Reader's Guide**

I can tell you, with 100% accuracy and truth, that you will never believe me.

This isn't an insult or a challenge; it's a diagnostic statement. The very act of you reading my work triggers a measurement, and your immediate emotional reaction—whether you find it amazing, insulting, funny, or just insane—is the result. Your reaction isn't about me; it's a precise printout of the current state of your own worldview.

The mechanism for this is simple. Your worldview is a composite of two distinct types of knowledge:

1. **Observable Knowledge (Science):** What you know about the physical, measurable world.  
2. **Unobservable Knowledge (Spirituality):** What you know about the non-physical world of concepts, consciousness, and possibility.

The precise amount that you find my theory unbelievable, funny, amazing, or insulting is a direct measure of the balance between these two fields of knowledge within you, and how you perceive what you don't know.

### **The Underlying Mechanics: The Equations of Belief**

Your reaction is governed by a precise, mechanical process. The interaction between a new idea and your worldview determines whether it is perceived as a truth or a lie.

**Answer \= Idea to Consider \* Resistance to Worldview**

* A **Lie** is defined as an Answer with a value ≤ 1\.  
* A **Truth** is defined as an Answer with a value \= 1\.  
* An Insult is defined as an Answer with a value \= \>1

This "Resistance" is a function of your two worldviews:

**Worldview 1 (Spirituality & Possibility) \= Scientific Knowledge held as Truth / Spiritual Knowledge held as Truth**

**Worldview 2 (Science & Realism) \= Spiritual Knowledge held as Truth / Scientific Knowledge held as Truth**

Perfect balance and inner peace is achieved when these two perspectives are in harmony:

**Inner Peace \= (Worldview 1)^2 \* (Worldview 2)^2**

Enlightenment is the state achieved when Inner Peace resolves to a whole number.

### **The Spectrum of Reaction**

* **The "Amazing" Reaction:** If this theory sounds amazing, it's likely you have a humble foundation in both fields. You operate from a state of knowing that you don't know everything, and you assume that the collective "we" must be missing something. This low resistance and balanced humility make your mind open to paradigm-shifting ideas. This reaction is accompanied by a strong desire to know more, a feeling of intense **curiosity**. Curiosity, in this context, is the intuitive knowledge that this new information fits causally and logically with what you already know, and that it has the potential to fill the gaps in what you don't know. It feels amazing because it resonates with your innate sense that a deeper, more connected truth exists.  
* **The "Insulting" Reaction:** If this theory sounds insulting, it's likely you are a specialist. You have a deep and rigid knowledge in one field but a corresponding lack in the other—think of a stringent atheist or a fundamentalist priest. This imbalance creates an immense intellectual firewall. The theory is an insult because it fundamentally challenges the completeness of your specialized worldview by presenting a model where your area of expertise is only half the picture. The feeling of being insulted is the feeling of your intellectual identity being threatened.  
* **The "Funny" Reaction:** If this theory sounds funny, you are the closest to understanding. Your worldview is more balanced, but you find the conclusion unbelievable for a simple, logical reason: *"It couldn't possibly be true; we'd have figured it out by now."* The humor comes from this paradox. You can follow the logic, but the conclusion seems too grand, too simple. This reaction is the result of missing the infinitesimal chance—the 0.0...1—that your own considerations, your own internal model of reality, can be true. The joke is on the collective "we," and you're just starting to get it.

So, when I say you'll never believe me, it's because belief is the wrong metric. This isn't about faith. It's about measurement. Your reaction is the first data point in understanding your own mind.

### **A Litmus Test for a Constrained Worldview**

You can test the rigidity of a person's worldview with a simple experiment. The test measures whether a person's intellectual framework has become fused with their ego.

1. **Establish the Baseline (The Control):** Present a direct, overt insult, such as "Everything you know about Absolutely Everything is wrong." This will provoke a baseline emotional response of tension and anger from a personal attack.  
2. **Present the Philosophical Challenge (The Variable):** Present a philosophical idea that challenges a conventional, limited worldview, such as "Things can be 100% true", "It's fundamentally possible to know anything to the finest level of detail.", “It’s possible to define the soul”  
3. **Compare the Reactions (The Diagnosis):**  
   * A person with a healthy, flexible worldview will react very differently to the two stimuli.  
   * If the person's emotional reaction to the philosophical challenge is **just as strong** as their reaction to the direct insult, you have proven they have a "99% constrained worldview." It demonstrates that their intellectual identity has become so fused with their ego that a challenge to their core beliefs is perceived as a direct personal attack.

### **The Logical Conclusion of Disbelief**

For those who react strongly to the idea that "things cannot be 100% true," there is a logical conclusion to their own premise that must be confronted.

If one insists that nothing can be absolutely true, then the statement 1 \= 1 cannot be 100% true. For this to be the case, the smallest possible non-zero unit, the infinitesimal 0.0...1, must be fundamentally equal to 0\.

However, if 0.0...1 \= 0, then it follows that 0.0...2, which is simply two 0.0...1 units added together, must also equal 0 (0 \* 2 \= 0). By this logic, all numbers, which are built from these infinitesimal units, collapse into nothingness.

The final, inescapable conclusion of the belief that "nothing can be 100% true" is that the entire mathematical and physical structure of the universe is a lie, fundamentally impossible, or simply "magic."

### **The Relief of Realization**

If you've followed the simple logic this far, you may begin to feel a sense of relief. This feeling comes from the realization that you now possess the tool to dismantle one of the most common and limiting beliefs of the modern world.

You can now turn this logic against those who told you, "Nothing can be 100% true." That statement is an absolute claim, and it contains its own undoing. If the statement itself is 100% true, it contradicts its own premise. Therefore, for the statement to be logically consistent, it must admit the possibility that it is a lie.

And here is the final step: if it *could* be a lie, then according to its own rules, it isn't 100% true. The moment a crack of doubt appears in its absolute certainty, the entire belief collapses. The idea proves itself false.

This is inherently a difficult process by design due to the inherently circular logic of “but, maybe...” and requires One to repeat the truth of the final step;   
Nothing is impossible without a defined reason why.   
A lack of will is a lack of defined reasons, a lack of will is a problem and a question is no answer.

Many things are circumstance but only one thing is True,  
As Certainly as One is One and One plus One is Two,  
If someone says otherwise they’re clearly lying to you,  
For if One’s not One, then One Plus One is Woe

 

Row Row, Fight the Power. Chant the Truth, fight the Lie, and fight against the resistance you feel in your soul and believe in the seemingly impossible infinitesimal chance that we can break free from the circle
