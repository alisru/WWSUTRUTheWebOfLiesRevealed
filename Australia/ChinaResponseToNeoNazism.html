Dragon’s Shadow: An Analysis of China’s Strategic Response to Neo-Nazism
in the Australian Theatre</strong></h1>
<h2 id="section-i-the-battlefield-survey-a-cast-of-key-actors"><strong>Section
I: The Battlefield Survey: A Cast of Key Actors</strong></h2>
<p>To comprehend the strategic dynamics at play within the Australian
theatre, it is imperative to first establish a comprehensive
understanding of the key actors, their roles, and the conceptual
frameworks that govern their interactions. The environment is not a
simple binary of opposing forces but a complex ecosystem of individuals,
organizations, and social factions operating within a broader,
undeclared narrative conflict.</p>
<h3 id="individuals-of-influence"><strong>1<a href="#citation-1">.1</a> Individuals of
Influence</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thomas Sewell:</strong> The self-appointed and established
leader of the National Socialist Network (NSN), Sewell functions as a
primary domestic agent of social disruption<a href="#citation-1">.1</a> He is a recidivist violent
actor with an extensive criminal record, including a prison sentence for
a 2021 attack on hikers and a conviction for assaulting a security
guard<a href="#citation-1">.1</a> At the time of the events in question, he was already on bail
for other offenses<a href="#citation-1">.1</a> His public speeches, such as the one delivered at
the “March for Australia” rally, articulate a violent vision and have
specifically targeted Chinese-Australian communities, providing a direct
vector for potential Chinese state media engagement that was ultimately
not utilized<a href="#citation-2">.2</a><br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese:</strong> As the head of the
Australian executive, Albanese is identified as the principal architect
of the government’s strategic response to domestic extremism<a href="#citation-1">.1</a> His
administration’s approach is defined by the doctrines of “Threat Triage”
and “Compliance Management.” His public characterization of rally
attendees as “good people” with “legitimate concerns” is analyzed not as
a political misstep but as a sophisticated psychological operation
designed to manage the allegiance of the uncommitted majority and
preserve the government’s political power, even at the expense of
long-term social cohesion<a href="#citation-1">.1</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="organizational-actors"><strong>1<a href="#citation-2">.2</a> Organizational
Actors</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>National Socialist Network (NSN):</strong> A domestic
neo-Nazi organization that serves as the primary instrument of social
chaos in this case study. The NSN was directly linked to the
anti-immigration rallies of August 31, 2025, and was responsible for the
subsequent premeditated, violent assault on the Camp Sovereignty First
Nations protest site<a href="#citation-1">.1</a> The group’s overt actions provide the raw
material for the Minimisation Plan’s core propaganda narrative: “See how
their freedom allows Nazis and extremists to roam the streets”<a href="#citation-1">.1</a> It is
notable that the NSN has also engaged in protests outside the Chinese
Consulate in Melbourne, indicating a complex posture that defies simple
categorization as a foreign proxy<a href="#citation-7">.7</a><br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Australian Government (Albanese Administration):</strong>
The central actor whose response is under analysis. The government
operates under a “Threat Triage” doctrine, responding with maximalist,
punitive force to threats against the state apparatus (e.g., alleged
subversion by the Iranian Regime) while adopting a permissive,
managerial stance toward threats against the social fabric, such as the
NSN<a href="#citation-1">.1</a> This permissive approach is identified as a functional enabler of
the Minimisation Plan’s objectives, as it allows for the persistence of
a chaotic social and informational environment that serves the narrative
of democratic failure<a href="#citation-1">.1</a><br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Chinese State Media Apparatus:</strong> This refers to the
collective of state-controlled media outlets, including Xinhua,
<em>Global Times</em>, <em>People’s Daily</em>, and <em>China
Daily</em>. Its primary function is to execute the narrative warfare
component of the Minimisation Plan. Its response to the specific events
in Australia is characterized by a “strategic silence,” which stands in
stark contrast to its persistent and high-volume thematic propaganda
concerning general societal decay in other Western nations<a href="#citation-8">.8</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="social-factions-conceptual-frameworks"><strong>1<a href="#citation-3">.3</a> Social
Factions &amp; Conceptual Frameworks</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Compliant:</strong> The ideologically uncommitted
majority of the population, identified as the center of gravity in the
conflict for social control<a href="#citation-1">.1</a> The thousands who attended the “March for
Australia” rallies are considered the physical embodiment of this
demographic. Both the Australian government, through its “Compliance
Management” strategy, and Minimiser actors are engaged in a constant
struggle for their allegiance<a href="#citation-1">.1</a><br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Minimisers &amp; Maximisers:</strong> These are the opposing
forces within the Minimisation Plan’s model of social dynamics.
Minimisers, exemplified by the NSN, are defined by their strategic
effect of destroying social cohesion and trust. Maximisers, analytically
proxied by groups like the Australian Greens, are those who work to
build and create “Greater Good” policies<a href="#citation-6">.6</a><br/>
</li>
<li><strong>The Minimisation Plan:</strong> The designation for an
observable, multi-decade grand strategy attributed to a Sino-Russian
axis. Its objective is not military conquest but the systematic erosion
of Western liberal democracies to make them appear unworkable<a href="#citation-6">.6</a> It
operates through Delusionism—the philosophy of making objective facts
irrelevant—and the manufacturing of crises to justify an authoritarian
alternative<a href="#citation-6">.6</a> The events in Australia serve as a key case study of the
Plan’s methodology.<br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Threat Triage &amp; Psochic Hegemony:</strong> These are the
core analytical frameworks used to deconstruct the Australian
government’s strategy. Threat Triage explains the <em>logic</em> behind
the government’s differentiated responses to various threats, revealing
a prioritization of the state over society<a href="#citation-1">.1</a> The Psochic Hegemony
provides a model to map the<br/>
<em>deceptiveness</em> of these responses, consistently identifying them
as “Greater Lies”—actions framed for the public good that are, in
reality, extractive and destructive to social cohesion<a href="#citation-1">.1</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It is crucial to recognize that the analytical frameworks presented
in the foundational documents are not neutral academic constructs. Their
mission-oriented language—“The Mission: Uncovering the ‘Hum’”—indicates
they are operational tools deployed by a counter-Minimiser faction<a href="#citation-6">.6</a>
Therefore, these frameworks are not merely observing the battlefield of
ideas; they are active participants, shaping the narrative by defining
the actors, objectives, and terms of engagement. This report, by
necessity, utilizes this lexicon to deconstruct the events, thereby
participating in the very narrative conflict it seeks to analyze.</p>
<p>The following table provides a consolidated reference for the key
actors and concepts that define this strategic environment.</p>

<h2 id="section-ii-the-signal-of-silence-chinas-direct-response-to-the-march-for-australia"><strong>Section
II: The Signal of Silence: China’s Direct Response to the ‘March for
Australia’</strong></h2>
<p>An exhaustive analysis of the Chinese state’s media response to the
neo-Nazi “March for Australia” and the subsequent attack on Camp
Sovereignty reveals a strategy defined not by overt propaganda, but by a
calculated and conspicuous absence thereof. This strategic silence,
punctuated by a single, carefully calibrated media trace, functions as a
sophisticated form of communication in itself.</p>
<h3 id="deconstruction-of-the-sole-media-trace-china-daily-asia"><strong>2<a href="#citation-1">.1</a>
Deconstruction of the Sole Media Trace: China Daily Asia</strong></h3>
<p>The only identifiable piece of coverage from a Chinese
state-affiliated media outlet concerning the events of August 31, 2025,
is a report from <em>China Daily Asia</em><a href="#citation-8">.8</a> A forensic deconstruction
of this article is revealing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content and Tone:</strong> The article is a factual,
agency-style report, devoid of original Chinese commentary,
condemnation, or analysis. Its primary function is to report the
Australian government’s own condemnation of the rallies. It prominently
quotes senior minister Murray Watt’s statements that the rallies were
intended to “spread hate” and were “organised and promoted by neo-Nazi
groups”<a href="#citation-8">.8</a> The tone is neutral and detached, mirroring that of a Western
wire service.<br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Sourcing and Framing:</strong> The piece deliberately
sources its information from Western outlets, including Sky News and the
Australian Broadcasting Corp<a href="#citation-8">.8</a> This is a critical choice. By framing the
news as a simple re-reporting of Australian sources, Beijing avoids
making any direct accusations. The implicit message becomes,
“Australia’s own government admits it has a Nazi problem,” a narrative
far more potent and defensible than a direct accusation from
China.<br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Platform and Audience:</strong> The choice of platform is
equally significant. <em>China Daily Asia</em> is an English-language
publication aimed primarily at an international, business, and
diplomatic audience located outside of mainland China. It is not a
primary vehicle for domestic propaganda or nationalist mobilization in
the way that outlets like <em>People’s Daily</em> or the <em>Global
Times</em> are.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="analysis-of-the-information-vacuum"><strong>2<a href="#citation-2">.2</a> Analysis of the
Information Vacuum</strong></h3>
<p>The most significant data point regarding China’s response is the
information vacuum. Extensive searches for coverage from primary
mainland propaganda outlets—including Xinhua, <em>Global Times</em>, and
<em>People’s Daily</em>—regarding the “March for Australia,” Thomas
Sewell, or the Camp Sovereignty attack yielded no results<a href="#citation-14">.14</a> This
absence cannot be interpreted as an oversight. Given the direct
targeting of the Chinese-Australian community by the rally’s speakers,
this silence is a deliberate strategic decision<a href="#citation-2">.2</a> The Minimisation Plan
primer notes Australia’s unique position as a Western democracy whose
economy is deeply intertwined with China<a href="#citation-6">.6</a> An overtly inflammatory
propaganda campaign, similar to those waged against the United States,
could jeopardize this crucial economic relationship, a risk evidenced by
recent tensions over investment screening<a href="#citation-17">.17</a></p>
<p>The decision to confine the response to a single, neutral report in
an external-facing publication, while keeping the powerful domestic
propaganda machinery silent, represents a sophisticated, multi-layered
strategy. This approach allows Beijing to signal to international
diplomatic and intelligence communities that it is aware of the event
and the racist targeting of its diaspora, without being drawn into a
direct and potentially costly diplomatic confrontation. It maintains
plausible deniability and preserves operational flexibility, keeping the
option open to either amplify or ignore similar events in the future
depending on the geopolitical climate. In this context, the Chinese
response was not a “cover” for active involvement, but rather a
low-cost, low-risk, passive intelligence and signaling operation. It was
a choice to observe and record the event’s corrosive effect on the
Australian social fabric rather than to actively shape it with a direct
propaganda campaign.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="section-iii-a-pattern-of-omission-timeline-and-frequency-analysis"><strong>Section
III: A Pattern of Omission: Timeline and Frequency
Analysis</strong></h2>
<p>Broadening the analytical aperture from the specific Australian
incident to China’s general coverage of Western extremism reveals a
clear and consistent pattern. The strategic silence regarding Australia
is not an isolated event but a stark anomaly when contrasted with the
high-volume, high-intensity narrative warfare waged against the United
States and the European Union. This demonstrates a highly targeted,
geopolitically motivated deployment of propaganda.</p>
<h3 id="high-volume-coverage-of-us-social-decay"><strong>3<a href="#citation-1">.1</a> High-Volume
Coverage of US Social Decay</strong></h3>
<p>Chinese state media outlets such as Xinhua and China News Service
publish frequent, in-depth, and highly critical articles detailing
systemic failures within the United States. This coverage is not
sporadic but forms a continuous, thematic drumbeat. Key narratives
include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Racial Hatred:</strong> Articles consistently frame the U.S.
as a nation being “torn apart” by racial hatred. They cite rising hate
crimes, systemic police brutality against minorities (with the George
Floyd case being a recurring example), and a growing rejection of
national symbols as evidence of a society in collapse<a href="#citation-18">.18</a><br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Political Polarization &amp; “Democratic Chaos”:</strong> A
cornerstone of this propaganda is the narrative that “American-style
democracy” is a failed model. Reports focus on partisan gridlock,
political violence such as the January 6th Capitol riot, and a
widespread loss of faith in democratic institutions to portray the
American system as fundamentally broken<a href="#citation-9">.9</a><br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Wealth Disparity:</strong> The widening gap between rich and
poor is presented as another vector of societal collapse, an inherent
failure of capitalism that fuels social unrest and proves the system’s
injustice<a href="#citation-21">.21</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="consistent-coverage-of-european-far-right-resurgence"><strong>3<a href="#citation-2">.2</a>
Consistent Coverage of European Far-Right Resurgence</strong></h3>
<p>Similarly, outlets like the <em>Global Times</em> regularly report on
the rise of far-right political parties across Europe, including in
Italy, France, Germany, Sweden, and Finland<a href="#citation-10">.10</a> The framing here is
slightly different but serves a similar strategic purpose:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Systemic Weakness:</strong> The resurgence of the far-right
is portrayed as a symptom of the European Union’s inherent structural
weaknesses. This narrative links the rise of these parties to the EU’s
inability to manage economic crises, the migrant crisis, and the fallout
from the COVID-19 pandemic<a href="#citation-10">.10</a><br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Erosion of Unity:</strong> The coverage emphasizes how these
parties leverage anti-immigrant and anti-EU sentiment to gain power,
thereby threatening the stability and coherence of the entire European
project and, by extension, the transatlantic alliance<a href="#citation-26">.26</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-australian-anomaly"><strong>3<a href="#citation-3">.3</a> The Australian
Anomaly</strong></h3>
<p>The near-total absence of similar thematic coverage focused on
Australia’s documented far-right problem is the critical anomaly.
Despite clear and public evidence of a growing, violent, and politically
active neo-Nazi movement—including the NSN’s public marches, violent
assaults, and infiltration of political parties—Chinese state media
refrains from weaponizing this issue in the same manner it does with
American and European examples<a href="#citation-1">.1</a></p>
<p>This differentiated approach reveals that China’s narrative warfare
is not a monolithic sledgehammer of general anti-Western criticism. It
is a geopolitical scalpel, applied with precision and varying intensity
based on the target nation’s strategic importance. The United States, as
China’s primary geopolitical rival, is subjected to a maximalist
narrative assault designed to degrade its global standing and challenge
its model of governance. The European Union, a key economic partner but
also a potential strategic competitor, is targeted with narratives
designed to exploit internal divisions and weaken its alignment with the
U.S. Australia, however, represents a different calculus: it is a firm
U.S. ally but also a critical and deeply integrated economic partner,
particularly as a supplier of essential resources<a href="#citation-6">.6</a> A full-scale,
U.S.-style propaganda campaign against Australia would risk damaging
this vital economic relationship. The strategic silence is therefore a
deliberate geopolitical calculation, prioritizing the stability of its
economic interests over the short-term propaganda victory that could be
scored by highlighting the NSN’s activities.</p>
<p>The following matrix visually represents this stark disparity in
media strategy.</p>

<h2 id="section-iv-the-minimisers-mirror-strategic-projection-and-the-narrative-of-decay"><strong>Section
IV: The Minimiser’s Mirror: Strategic Projection and the Narrative of
Decay</strong></h2>
<p>While China’s state media remained silent on the specific neo-Nazi
events in Australia, its broader propaganda ecosystem is perfectly
calibrated to amplify the general “Narrative of Decay,” a core tactic of
the Minimisation Plan. This narrative functions through a powerful
psychological mechanism: strategic projection. The accusations leveled
against the West are often a direct mirror of the Minimisation Plan’s
own intentions and actions, a method designed to create cognitive
dissonance and achieve a state of “Delusionism.”</p>
<h3 id="deconstructing-the-narrative-of-decay"><strong>4<a href="#citation-1">.1</a>
Deconstructing the “Narrative of Decay”</strong></h3>
<p>The Minimisation Plan primer explicitly outlines the tactic of
“manufactured justification”: Minimiser agents actively cultivate and
amplify societal failures within democracies, and then their propaganda
arms present these manufactured crises as evidence of the democratic
system’s inherent weakness<a href="#citation-6">.6</a> Chinese media articles execute this
strategy with precision, focusing relentlessly on themes of chaos,
division, and decay in the West. These reports are the second stage of
the operation: they report on the “evidence” that the Plan’s covert
influence campaigns helped to create.</p>
<h3 id="case-studies-in-strategic-projection"><strong>4<a href="#citation-2">.2</a> Case Studies
in Strategic Projection</strong></h3>
<p>A direct comparison between the Minimisation Plan’s stated tactics
and the narratives deployed by Chinese state media reveals a consistent
pattern of strategic projection.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Projection 1: Accusation of Democratic Failure.</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimiser Tactic:</strong> “Look how their democracy creates
evil and corrupt leaders… making democracy appear chaotic, corrupt, and
ultimately unworkable”<a href="#citation-6">.6</a><br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Chinese Media Narrative:</strong> An article from China News
Service describes “American-style democracy” as suffering from a
“governance failure,” citing intense partisan fighting, political
polarization, and violent events like the storming of the Capitol as
definitive proof that the system is fundamentally broken and
unstable<a href="#citation-9">.9</a><br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Analysis:</strong> This narrative projects the Minimisation
Plan’s <em>objective</em> (to make democracy appear unworkable) as an
already existing, organic <em>state of being</em> within the target
nation. The media reports on the symptoms of the disease that the Plan
itself is actively trying to spread.<br/>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Projection 2: Accusation of Fostering Extremism.</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimiser Tactic:</strong> “See how their freedom allows
Nazis and extremists to roam the streets” (while using information
warfare to amplify extremist voices and fan the flames of racial hatred,
creating a self-fulfilling prophecy)<a href="#citation-6">.6</a><br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Chinese Media Narrative:</strong> A Xinhua feature details
how “racial hatred tears America apart,” focusing on the rise of hate
crimes and the formation of white supremacist militias<a href="#citation-18">.18</a> Another piece
argues that the George Floyd incident “ignited” America’s deep-seated
racial contradictions, leading to widespread social unrest<a href="#citation-19">.19</a><br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Analysis:</strong> This is a direct execution of the
Minimiser script. The media reports on the visible manifestation of
extremism, framing it as an inherent and unavoidable flaw of a free and
open society. It conveniently omits the role of external influence
campaigns in amplifying those very extremist voices. The Australian
case, where the government’s own permissive inaction allows the “fire”
of extremism to burn, serves as a perfect real-world example of this
principle, even without direct Chinese amplification of the specific
event.<br/>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Projection 3: Accusation of Israeli “Neo-Nazism”.</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chinese Media Narrative:</strong> A Voice of America report
notes that in the aftermath of the October 7th Hamas attack, one of the
most-liked comments on an Israeli consulate’s social media post in China
read: “Down with Jewish terrorism and Israeli neo-Nazism”<a href="#citation-32">.32</a><br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Analysis:</strong> This is a potent and extreme example of
narrative inversion and Delusionism. The term “Nazi” is deliberately
stripped of its historical meaning and projected onto the Jewish state
itself. This tactic serves to create maximum cognitive dissonance and
epistemic nihilism, perfectly aligning with the Minimisation Plan’s
ultimate goal of making “the very concept of ‘facts’ irrelevant”<a href="#citation-6">.6</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>This consistent mirroring between the tactics described in the
Minimisation Plan primer and the narratives deployed by Chinese state
media is not coincidental. It is a core mechanism of Delusionism. By
accusing an adversary of doing precisely what one is doing or intends to
do, it confuses attribution, muddies the informational environment, and
preemptively neutralizes counter-accusations by framing them as mere
“whataboutism.” This creates a feedback loop: the Plan’s actions help
generate real-world chaos, and the state media then reports on this
chaos as “proof” that its initial critique of democracy was correct all
along. The “Narrative of Decay” is not just propaganda; it is an
integral weapon in a broader strategic warfare doctrine.</p>

<h2 id="section-v-synthesis-and-assessment-the-symbiosis-of-inaction"><strong>Section
V: Synthesis and Assessment: The Symbiosis of Inaction</strong></h2>
<p>The cumulative evidence does not support the hypothesis that China’s
response to the Australian neo-Nazi events was a “generated cover.” A
cover implies an attempt to hide active involvement. The evidence points
instead to a deliberate <em>lack</em> of direct involvement in the
narrative space surrounding this specific incident. The strategy was not
to cover tracks, but to leave no tracks in the first place. This
approach reveals something far more sophisticated: a strategy of
opportunistic observation that leverages the Australian government’s own
domestic political strategy, creating a symbiotic relationship that
quietly advances the Minimisation Plan’s ultimate objectives.</p>
<h3 id="the-symbiotic-reinforcement-loop"><strong>5<a href="#citation-1">.1</a> The Symbiotic
Reinforcement Loop</strong></h3>
<p>A symbiotic reinforcement loop has been established between the
domestic political strategy of the Australian government and the
geopolitical strategy of the Chinese state.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Australian Government Action:</strong> The Albanese
government, guided by its “Threat Triage” doctrine, employs a strategy
of permissive inaction and “Compliance Management” towards the NSN. This
choice is driven by domestic political calculations: a desire to avoid
alienating “The Compliant,” the uncommitted voters who attended the
rallies<a href="#citation-1">.1</a> The strategic<br/>
<em>effect</em>, however, is that a violent extremist group is permitted
to operate publicly, actively creating social division and providing a
real-world proof-of-concept for the Minimisation Plan’s narrative of
democratic failure.<br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Chinese Government Action:</strong> The Chinese state, in
turn, employs “Strategic Silence” on this specific Australian incident,
thereby avoiding diplomatic friction and protecting its vital economic
relationship. Simultaneously, it maintains its global “Narrative of
Decay,” using events <em>like</em> the NSN’s activities (but sourced
from the U.S. and EU) as general, non-specific proof of broad Western
decline<a href="#citation-10">.10</a><br/>
</li>
<li><strong>The Symbiosis:</strong> The Australian government’s inaction
creates the raw material—the “permissible fire” of extremism—that
validates the Minimisation Plan’s global narrative. China does not need
to risk a direct and costly propaganda campaign against Australia
because the Australian government’s own strategy is already degrading
its domestic social fabric, achieving the Minimisation Plan’s objective
by proxy. As the foundational analysis concludes, the state is
preserved, but society is degraded—the ultimate goal of the Plan<a href="#citation-1">.1</a></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="mapping-the-strategy-on-the-psochic-hegemony"><strong>5<a href="#citation-2">.2</a>
Mapping the Strategy on the Psochic Hegemony</strong></h3>
<p>When mapped on the Psochic Hegemony framework, the deceptive nature
of both strategies becomes quantifiable.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Australian government’s response is a classic “Greater Lie.” It
is framed as a proactive (+ψ) move for the “Greater Good” (+υ) of
maintaining social harmony and preventing radicalization. However, its
true function is profoundly extractive (−υ), sacrificing the safety and
security of minority communities for the government’s narrow political
goal of managing a key demographic<a href="#citation-1">.1</a><br/>
</li>
<li>China’s broader media strategy is also a “Greater Lie.” It is framed
as objective reporting (+ψ) for the “Greater Good” (+υ) of informing its
audience about world events. Its true function is extractive (−υ),
designed to erode global trust in democratic systems and advance its own
authoritarian model. The significant distance between the framed intent
and the true effect is a direct measure of the strategy’s
dishonesty<a href="#citation-11">.11</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="strategic-patience-and-the-efficiency-of-leveraging-internal-decay"><strong>5<a href="#citation-3">.3</a>
Strategic Patience and the Efficiency of Leveraging Internal
Decay</strong></h3>
<p>The Minimisation Plan, as demonstrated in this Australian case study,
reveals a highly efficient and patient methodology. It expends minimal
direct resources on influencing the Australian information space,
instead allowing Australia’s own internal political dynamics and
strategic choices to produce the desired outcome. The Australian
government’s “Threat Triage” doctrine is a known vulnerability; the
government has publicly signaled it will not act decisively against this
type of social threat<a href="#citation-1">.1</a> Therefore, the most efficient strategy for the
Minimisation Plan is to simply allow this internal process of decay to
play out.</p>
<p>This demonstrates the “rhizomatic” nature of the conflict described
in the primer: the Plan does not require a central command directing
every action; it spreads by exploiting and nourishing existing
weaknesses within the target system<a href="#citation-6">.6</a> The domestic political strategy of
the Australian government and the geopolitical strategy of the Chinese
government align perfectly in their outcome: the managed degradation of
Australian social cohesion.</p>
<p>The most significant threat is not always a direct attack, but the
subtle, patient exploitation of a nation’s own internal contradictions.
The Chinese response is a masterclass in strategic patience,
demonstrating that sometimes the most powerful move is to do nothing and
allow an adversary’s own choices to lead toward their decline. The
silence was not an absence of strategy; the silence <em>was</em> the
strategy.</p>
