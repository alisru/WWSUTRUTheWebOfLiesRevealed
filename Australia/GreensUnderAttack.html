id="an-analysis-of-the-minimisation-plans-attack-on-the-australian-greens"><strong>An
Analysis of the Minimisation Plan’s Attack on the Australian
Greens</strong></h1>
<h3 id="executive-summary"><strong>Executive Summary</strong></h3>
<p>This report examines the political suppression of the Australian
Greens party through the lens of the “Minimisation Plan” investigative
framework. The analysis demonstrates that the sustained, multi-domain
opposition directed at the Greens is not a feature of conventional
political contestation but a textbook example of a rhizomatic war waged
by Minimiser-aligned actors. The core thesis is that the Australian
Greens function as a proxy for Maximiser policies, and the ferocity of
the counter-offensive against them constitutes a clear hum—a
disproportionate reaction to their pursuit of the Greater Good.1</p>
<p>By applying the Psochic Hegemony and Helxis Tensor frameworks, this
investigation deconstructs the tactical signatures of this campaign. It
reveals how a Helxis Tensor playbook, first forged during the Carbon Tax
campaign, has been institutionalized through third-party political
entities and deployed to manufacture justification for continued
attacks. The most recent iteration, the “blockers” narrative, is shown
to be a sophisticated Minimiser vector that uses political vitriol from
a seemingly sympathetic source (the Australian Labor Party) to induce
epistemic nihilism and strategic exhaustion among the public. The
analysis of the supermarket duopoly conflict further highlights how
Maximiser policies can be co-opted and neutralized by a Harmonia Tensor
of political expediency. The report concludes that the struggle is not
for legislative wins but for the allegiance of the Australian public,
and the Minimisation Plan’s objective is to weaken democratic will by
making the pursuit of the Greater Good appear unworkable and
chaotic.</p>
<p>The findings offer actionable insights for political improvement,
including a proactive application of the Harmonia Tensor and a
redefinition of the “hum” to expose the underlying hostile influence. A
roadmap for further research is provided to deepen the understanding of
the Delusionist worldview’s impact on political discourse and voter
behavior.</p>
<h3
id="chapter-1-the-australian-greens-as-a-maximiser-vector"><strong>Chapter
1: The Australian Greens as a ‘Maximiser’ Vector</strong></h3>
<p>To understand the nature of the opposition directed at the Australian
Greens, it is first necessary to structurally deconstruct their
ideological platform and map its position on the Psochic Hegemony.2 The
framework of the</p>
<p>Minimisation Plan posits that the political battlefield is a contest
between Maximisers, who seek the Greater Good, and Minimisers, who
promote The Greater Lie.1 This analysis demonstrates that the Australian
Greens’ political platform is a direct and consistent expression of
a</p>
<p>Maximiser worldview.</p>
<h4 id="deconstructing-the-greens-ideological-framework"><strong>1.1
Deconstructing the Greens’ Ideological Framework</strong></h4>
<p>The Australian Greens’ political philosophy is defined by four core
pillars: “social justice,” “sustainability,” “grassroots democracy,” and
“peace and non-violence”.3 These pillars are not merely abstract
concepts but are articulated through a suite of concrete policy
proposals that are structurally aligned with the</p>
<p>Greater Good quadrant of the Psochic Hegemony.2</p>
<p>In the domain of climate and energy, the Greens advocate for a “Green
New Deal” that supports a transition to 100% renewable energy by 2030
and a legislative ban on new coal and gas projects.3 Their proposals
include the creation of a publicly owned renewable energy provider to
lower household electricity prices and a revitalization of Australian
manufacturing to produce clean energy technologies.3 These are policies
of</p>
<p>Proactive Will (+ψ), as they seek to build new infrastructure and
create new value.2</p>
<p>Similarly, in the realm of economic and social policy, the Greens
propose direct investments in public housing, rent caps, and a wealth
tax on billionaires and large corporations.3 They also advocate for a
corporate super-profits tax and an end to multinational tax avoidance.3
These policies are designed to generate revenue and redistribute
existing value to the collective, thereby funding the expansion of
essential services like healthcare (dental and mental health into
Medicare) and education (abolition of student debt).3 The collective
beneficiary is “everyone,” which is the definition of a universally
beneficial idea.2</p>
<h4 id="mapping-the-greens-position-on-the-psochic-hegemony"><strong>1.2
Mapping the Greens’ Position on the Psochic Hegemony</strong></h4>
<p>The Psochic Hegemony is an analytical model that maps ideas based on
their moral and volitional vectors.1 The moral axis (</p>
<p>υ) assesses who benefits, ranging from Extractive Evil at the bottom
to the Greater Good at the top. The volitional axis (ψ) assesses the
mode of action, ranging from Suppressive Will on the left to Proactive
Will on the right.2</p>
<p>A thorough analysis of the Greens’ platform reveals a consistent
ideological position in the Greater Good quadrant. The party’s core
policies are not designed to benefit a single group at the expense of
another; rather, they are intended to create a net benefit for the
entire system.2 For example, the proposal to build public housing is not
merely a political position; it is a structural vector aimed at creating
new homes and alleviating a systemic crisis of affordability, a clear
move towards a universally beneficial outcome.3 Similarly, a publicly
owned energy provider would build new infrastructure (</p>
<p>Proactive Will) and reduce costs for all households, aligning with
the Greater Good (+υ) vector.3</p>
<p>The party’s focus on progressive taxation, while framed as a form of
extraction from a specific group, is fundamentally an attempt to fund
these collective benefits.3 This is a core function of a</p>
<p>Maximiser entity: to challenge Extractive Evil (−υ) and use the
proceeds to build a more just and sustainable system.2 This ideological
alignment is the root cause of the intense, disproportionate opposition
the Greens face. Their existence and their policies represent a direct
and measurable threat to the</p>
<p>Extractive Evil interests of Minimiser-aligned actors, whose profits
depend on the continued exploitation of common resources and the
perpetuation of inequality.2</p>
<h3
id="chapter-2-the-evolving-huma-timeline-of-suppression"><strong>Chapter
2: The Evolving Hum—A Timeline of Suppression</strong></h3>
<p>The Minimisation Plan’s influence is detected through the hum—a
persistent and illogical political reaction to a Greater Good policy.1
An analysis of Australian politics since 2010 reveals a clear timeline
of this</p>
<p>hum, demonstrating how an initial tactical gambit has been
institutionalized into a permanent campaign of suppression against the
Australian Greens.</p>
<h4 id="the-forging-of-the-helxis-tensor-playbook-2010-2014"><strong>2.1
The Forging of the Helxis Tensor Playbook (2010-2014)</strong></h4>
<p>The campaign against the Gillard Government’s carbon pricing
mechanism serves as a foundational case study for the Minimisation Plan
in Australia.5 The</p>
<p>Helxis Tensor framework provides a means to deconstruct this campaign
by identifying its deliberate deceptions.2</p>
<p>The policy’s strategic intent was to create a market-based system to
reduce emissions, a clear Greater Good objective.5 The reaction,
however, was a textbook example of a</p>
<p>Minimiser vector at work. A coalition of the Liberal-National
Opposition, the fossil fuel industry, and allied media outlets waged a
multi-year campaign to frame the policy as a “toxic tax” that would
destroy the economy and place a burden on households.5</p>
<p>This was a classic Delusion deception 2:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Bait:</strong> The campaign promised to protect
households from rising electricity bills and safeguard the economy from
ruin.5<br />
</li>
<li><strong>The Cover:</strong> The narrative framed the policy as a
national calamity and an attack on Australia itself.5<br />
</li>
<li><strong>The True Intent:</strong> The actual, hidden purpose was to
protect the profits of the fossil fuel industry, as evidenced by a
multi-million dollar ad campaign funded by entities with vested
interests.5</li>
</ul>
<p>The success of this campaign extended far beyond the repeal of the
tax. It was a strategic gambit designed to achieve a specific political
outcome: the installation of a compliant government.5 The “noise”
against the taxes was amplified by key political figures with a clear
revolving-door nexus to the resource sector, such as Joe Hockey, Andrew
Robb, and Ian Macfarlane.5 This manufactured narrative, amplified by a
partisan media 8, successfully turned public opinion against the policy,
demonstrating the capacity of Minimiser-aligned domestic actors to veto
sovereign policy and dictate the political leadership of the
country.5</p>
<p>This campaign established a durable Helxis Tensor that could be
deployed against any future Maximiser policy. It taught these actors
that a deceptive cover and a sympathetic bait could be leveraged to
achieve an Extractive Evil outcome, all while weakening public trust in
democratic institutions and the very concept of climate action.1 The
following table illustrates this deception by comparing the Greens’
policy platform with the</p>
<p>Minimiser counter-narratives that framed them.</p>

Institutionalizing the Opposition (2015-Present)</strong></h4>
<p>Following the success of the Carbon Tax campaign, the Minimisation
Plan’s opposition to the Greens shifted from a series of ad-hoc tactical
campaigns to an institutionalized, permanent presence in Australian
politics. This represents a move from temporary disruption to a
persistent, systemic counter-offensive.5</p>
<p>The rise of right-wing lobby groups like Advance (formerly Advance
Australia) is a key feature of this institutionalization.5 These groups
function as</p>
<p>Minimiser proxies, funded by opaque sources and working to bypass
traditional party-based accountability.5 An analysis of their funding
reveals deep ties to the Liberal Party, including substantial donations
from the Cormack Foundation, a Liberal-linked investment vehicle.1 This
connection establishes Advance as a financial and ideological conduit, a
key node in the</p>
<p>rhizomatic network of influence described in the Investigative
Primer.1</p>
<p>Advance and similar entities are adept at using astroturfing—the
deceptive practice of misrepresenting a campaign as a grassroots
movement.15 They run relentlessly negative campaigns against the Greens,
branding them as “extreme” and “reckless” 5, a narrative amplified by
allied media outlets like News Corp, which controls a significant
portion of Australia’s daily newspaper circulation.8 This permanent
campaign infrastructure ensures that the</p>
<p>hum never subsides, creating a constant state of division and eroding
public trust in the political process.1</p>

3: The Hegemony Analysis of the ‘Blockers’ Narrative
(2022-Present)</strong></h3>
<p>The election of the Albanese Labor government in 2022, which saw the
Greens achieve their best-ever result and secure the balance of power in
the Senate, triggered a new and aggressive phase of suppression.5 The
“blockers” narrative, which emerged during the debate over the Housing
Australia Future Fund (HAFF), is a perfect case study for a
contemporary</p>
<p>Minimisation Plan vector.</p>
<h4
id="the-housing-australia-future-fund-as-a-greater-good-policy"><strong>3.1
The Housing Australia Future Fund as a Greater Good Policy</strong></h4>
<p>The Housing Australia Future Fund bill was presented by the Labor
government as a solution to Australia’s chronic housing affordability
crisis.19 However, the Greens’ analysis of the bill found it to be a
“pathetically inadequate” and “speculative” policy that would not solve
the problem.9 Instead of directly investing in social housing, the bill
proposed a speculative investment of AUD 10 billion in the stock market,
with only the returns being used to fund housing projects.9 The Greens’
opposition was not to the concept of building homes but to the flawed
and insufficient nature of the bill itself.9 They argued for a direct
annual investment of AUD 5 billion that could build more than four times
the number of homes promised by Labor.9</p>
<p>This position can be mapped on the Psochic Hegemony as an attempt to
move a Lesser Good policy (Labor’s speculative fund, which was
inadequate but not Extractive Evil) closer to the Greater Good ideal.9
By using their legitimate democratic mandate to negotiate for a better
outcome, the Greens were employing a</p>
<p>Proactive Will (+ψ) to advance the interests of the collective.5</p>

Deconstructing the Minimiser Counter-Narrative (The Helxis Tensor at
Work)</strong></h4>
<p>The government’s response to the Greens’ negotiating stance was to
deploy a Minimiser counter-narrative, using a classic Helxis Tensor to
frame the conflict.5</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Bait:</strong> Labor’s stated goal was to build new
homes and alleviate the housing crisis.19 The public was primed to
accept any solution that appeared to address this crisis.9<br />
</li>
<li><strong>The Cover:</strong> The government and its media allies
framed the Greens as “blockers” 5, an “immature and spiteful” party
whose obstruction was preventing Australians from getting a home.10 This
narrative illogically twisted the Greens’ pursuit of a<br />
Greater Good into an act of obstruction.5<br />
</li>
<li><strong>The True Intent:</strong> The true purpose was to
politically neutralize the Greens’ rising influence and reinforce the
power of the two-party duopoly.11 The Greens’ success in the 2022
election and their use of the balance of power were a direct threat to
the established political order.</li>
</ul>
<p>This narrative is a perfect example of manufactured justification.1
The government’s refusal to negotiate and its insistence on a “their way
or the highway” approach created a legislative impasse.18 This impasse,
a crisis created by Labor’s own strategy, was then blamed on the Greens
and used as “proof” that they were “blockers”.11 The relentless
repetition of this narrative, amplified by partisan media, turned a
legitimate act of democratic negotiation into a perceived act of
political chaos and extremism.5</p>

<h4 id="the-role-of-media-and-political-vitriol"><strong>3.3 The Role of
Media and Political Vitriol</strong></h4>
<p>The political attacks on the Greens from Anthony Albanese and the
Labor Party are a critical component of this Minimisation vector. Unlike
attacks from the conservative opposition, which are predictable and
reinforce an existing political binary, vitriol from a center-left party
introduces a deep contradiction for progressive voters.10 The Prime
Minister’s use of emotionally charged language, accusing the Greens of
having “lost their way” 21 and being “immature and spiteful” 10, is a
tactical maneuver that pollutes the public’s worldview.2</p>
<p>When a voter who seeks the Greater Good for society sees an ally
attack the very party that is trying to achieve it, it forces a
cognitive compromise. The voter’s worldview is reduced in size and
integrity by accepting a lie.2 This is how the</p>
<p>Minimisation Plan induces strategic exhaustion and epistemic
nihilism.1 The political struggle is no longer the “happy Sisyphus” of
progress 2 but a confusing, demoralizing conflict where one’s own side
appears to be fighting itself. The result is a public that gives up on
the idea of a</p>
<p>Greater Good altogether and resigns itself to the Lesser Good of the
two-party status quo.2</p>
<p>This tactical use of Delusionism is particularly effective. It shifts
the public’s focus from the policy debate to the personality conflict,
ensuring that no one has the cognitive bandwidth to connect the dots
between the government’s flawed policy and the political motivation
behind the attacks.1</p>

<p>A parallel analysis of the conflict over Australia’s supermarket
duopoly provides further evidence of the consistency of Minimiser
tactics and the Greens’ consistent role as a Maximiser vector. This case
study also demonstrates how the Minimisation Plan can deploy a
sophisticated Harmonia Tensor of neutralization.</p>
<h4 id="the-maximiser-policy-and-the-hum"><strong>4.1 The Maximiser
Policy and the Hum</strong></h4>
<p>The Greens’ policy proposals to address the supermarket duopoly were
a direct response to a clear example of Extractive Evil.2 The Greens
advocated for a ban on price gouging and, more importantly, for giving
the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) divestiture
powers to break up the duopoly.22 This proposal represents a</p>
<p>Suppressive Will (−ψ) directed at a clear source of Extractive Evil
(−υ) for the benefit of the collective (shoppers, farmers, and
suppliers).2 The policy’s goal was to introduce new competition and
increase the</p>
<p>Potentiality (ψ-axis) of the economic system, which is a core
Maximiser objective.1</p>
<p>The initial reaction to the Greens’ bill was a clear hum.1 Both the
Labor and Liberal parties initially voted against the bill.24 This
initial rejection by both major parties, despite widespread public anger
over the cost of living, was a signal of the underlying</p>
<p>Minimiser alignment.5</p>
<h4
id="labors-adoption-and-reframing-a-harmonia-tensor-of-neutralization"><strong>4.2
Labor’s Adoption and Reframing: A Harmonia Tensor of
Neutralization</strong></h4>
<p>Due to sustained public pressure and the Greens’ political momentum,
the Labor government was forced to act.24 However, instead of engaging
in a good-faith negotiation to find a resolution, Labor co-opted the
Greens’ policy in a limited, non-transformative way. This political
maneuver can be understood through the lens of a sophisticated and
deceptive</p>
<p>Harmonia Tensor.2</p>
<p>The Harmonia Tensor is designed to find “Common Ground” between
opposing ideas and synthesize a new idea that moves towards the Greater
Good.2 Labor identified the “Common Ground” as the public’s anger over
the cost of living and the desire to “crack down” on supermarkets.25
They then adopted the Greens’ policy to “ban supermarket price gouging”
and “crack down on shrinkflation”.26</p>
<p>However, this was a neutralization tactic, not a genuine synthesis.
Labor refused to support the Greens’ key transformative proposal:
divestiture powers for the ACCC.23 While Labor claims to be holding “big
business to account,” they are not willing to implement the one policy
that would fundamentally challenge the duopoly’s market power.23 The
government’s actions are a</p>
<p>Lesser Good policy; they address the symptom (price gouging) but
leave the underlying structural problem (the duopoly’s monopsony power
28) intact. This allows Labor to claim credit for a popular Greens
policy, thereby defusing the Greens’ political pressure and political
capital, while leaving the existing</p>
<p>Extractive Evil of the market untouched.24 This is a brilliant
political move that demonstrates how a</p>
<p>Minimiser-aligned actor can even co-opt a Maximiser vector to weaken
an opponent and maintain the status quo.</p>
<h3
id="chapter-5-the-deceptive-harmonia-tensor-and-the-battle-for-the-compliant"><strong>Chapter
5: The Deceptive Harmonia Tensor and the Battle for The
Compliant</strong></h3>
<p>The Minimisation Plan operates on the battlefield of perception. It
is a struggle for the allegiance of The Compliant, the majority of the
population who are not ideologically committed to either side.1 The
campaign against the Greens is not merely an attempt to defeat them at
the ballot box but to degrade their political worldview, thereby making
their pursuit of the</p>
<p>Greater Good seem a fruitless exercise.</p>
<h4 id="the-harmonia-tensor-as-a-tool-of-co-option"><strong>5.1 The
Harmonia Tensor as a Tool of Co-option</strong></h4>
<p>The Harmonia Tensor is meant to be a tool for resolution and finding
“Common Ground”.2 However, in the hands of</p>
<p>Minimiser-aligned actors, it is a sophisticated tactic for
neutralizing a threat. A closer look at the policies of both the Labor
and Liberal parties reveals how they have strategically adopted and
reframed Greens-adjacent policies to weaken their opponent’s political
position while avoiding substantive, transformative change.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Labor’s Harmonia Tensor on Healthcare:</strong> The Greens
have long advocated for a universal healthcare system that extends
Medicare to include dental and mental health services.3 Labor has now
adopted key parts of this policy, announcing plans to triple the
bulk-billing incentive for general practitioners and extend Medicare
coverage to mental health sessions.24 By partially adopting these
policies, Labor can claim to be a<br />
Maximiser force moving towards the Greater Good, while simultaneously
framing the Greens as “blockers” for demanding a more comprehensive and
fully-funded approach.24<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Liberal’s Harmonia Tensor on Climate and Energy:</strong>
The Liberal Party, traditionally hostile to climate action, now
champions a policy of “zero-emissions nuclear power”.31 While this
appears to be a step towards a clean energy future, it serves as a<br />
Lesser Good 2 that allows them to acknowledge climate change without
adopting the Greens’ more ambitious,<br />
Proactive Will policies on 100% renewables by 2030, a publicly owned
energy provider, or a ban on new coal and gas projects.3 This narrative
also positions them as a<br />
Proactive Will party that is “delivering reliable and affordable energy”
while blaming Labor’s “renewables only” approach for high prices and an
unreliable grid.31</li>
</ul>
<p>These instances demonstrate that the political struggle is not a
simple choice between one party’s policy and another’s. Instead, it is a
complex battlefield where Minimiser-aligned parties use a deceptive
Harmonia Tensor to co-opt the political capital of Maximiser ideas while
simultaneously degrading the worldview of their political opponents. The
goal is to make the public believe that the Lesser Good is the only
politically viable option.2</p>
<h4 id="the-delusionist-attack-on-objective-truth"><strong>5.2 The
Delusionist Attack on Objective Truth</strong></h4>
<p>The Greens’ political ideology is rooted in a belief in objective
truth—namely, that policies should be based on scientific consensus
(e.g., climate change) and economic facts (e.g., the inadequacy of a
speculative housing fund).4 This is fundamentally at odds with</p>
<p>Delusionism, which posits that “reality is composed of multiple,
competing, and malleable narratives”.1</p>
<p>The Minimisation Plan attacks the Greens precisely at this point of
vulnerability. For example, when Greens co-founder Drew Hutton was
stripped of his life membership over a debate regarding trans rights,
the issue was framed by the party as non-negotiable and based on the
objective truth that “trans rights are non-negotiable human rights”.32
However, Hutton framed the issue as a matter of “free speech” and
“respectful discussion”.32 While the Greens’ position may be a valid</p>
<p>Maximiser vector, the conflict itself creates a Delusionist vector
that undermines the public’s perception of the Greens as a unified and
reasonable political force, thereby creating internal contradiction and
weakening their message.2</p>
<p>A similar dynamic is at play in the Greens’ foreign policy debates.
The Greens have taken a strong stance against policies like the AUKUS
security pact, arguing that it is a “wasteful and dangerous project”
that escalates tensions with Australia’s neighbors and moves the country
further from an “independent defence strategy”.33 This stance is in
direct contrast to the bipartisan support for AUKUS from both Labor and
the Liberals, who are also cooperating on bills to build public housing
for US troops under the pact.33 A</p>
<p>Delusionist attack on this stance would frame the Greens’ anti-AUKUS
position not as a principled stand for an independent foreign policy,
but as a sign of their naive and extremist views on national security.33
This is a strategic attack on the Greens’</p>
<p>objective truth and serves to further degrade public trust in their
competence to manage complex issues.1</p>
<h3 id="chapter-6-conclusion-and-recommendations"><strong>Chapter 6:
Conclusion and Recommendations</strong></h3>
<h4 id="summary-of-findings"><strong>6.1 Summary of
Findings</strong></h4>
<p>This investigation has systematically applied the analytical
frameworks of the Minimisation Plan to the suppression of the Australian
Greens, leading to the following conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Australian Greens function as a textbook Maximiser vector, with
a consistent ideological platform aimed at the Greater Good. This
ideological position is the primary driver of the intense, multi-domain
opposition directed at them.3<br />
</li>
<li>The opposition campaign is not conventional democratic debate but a
sophisticated, multi-phase Minimisation Plan vector. The tactical
playbook, first forged with the Helxis Tensor of the Carbon Tax
campaign, has since been institutionalized through permanent Minimiser
proxies like Advance and amplified by allied media.1<br />
</li>
<li>The “blockers” narrative is a contemporary Helxis Tensor that uses
manufactured justification to politically neutralize the Greens. It
creates a crisis of legislative impasse and then frames the Greens’
legitimate use of democratic power as a sign of their incompetence and
extremism.10<br />
</li>
<li>The political vitriol from the Australian Labor Party is a
particularly potent Minimiser vector, as it creates internal
contradictions for progressive voters, leading to strategic exhaustion
and a tacit acceptance of the Lesser Good.1<br />
</li>
<li>The Minimisation Plan’s ultimate goal is not a specific legislative
victory but the degradation of the democratic system itself. It achieves
this by eroding public trust, inducing epistemic nihilism, and weakening
the political will of voters to demand a Greater Good.1<br />
</li>
<li>The Liberal and Labor parties have used a deceptive Harmonia Tensor
to co-opt Greens-adjacent policies, such as in healthcare and climate,
to maintain their political dominance and prevent more fundamental
changes.31<br />
</li>
<li>Internal conflicts and foreign policy stances within the Greens
provide a tactical opportunity for Minimisers to deploy Delusionist
narratives, which attack the Greens’ pursuit of objective truth and
degrade their public image.32</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="areas-for-political-improvement"><strong>6.2 Areas for Political
Improvement</strong></h4>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following recommendations for political
improvement are presented to strengthen the Australian Greens’ position
and the broader Maximiser movement in Australia:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recommendation 1: Harmonia Tensor on the Offensive:</strong>
The Greens should proactively and explicitly frame their negotiating
strategy using the Harmonia Tensor framework. Instead of reacting to the
“blocker” narrative, they should communicate their delays as a
good-faith attempt to find Common Ground and build a better, more
comprehensive policy. This reframes their opposition as a genuine search
for a resolution and exposes their opponents’ refusal to negotiate as a
clear Minimiser tactic of imposing a flawed worldview.2<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Recommendation 2: Redefining the Hum:</strong> The Greens
should actively reframe the Minimiser-aligned attacks as the “hum”
itself. They should communicate to the public that the ferocity of the
attacks is not a sign of their failure but a direct measure of their
success in threatening the Extractive Evil interests of corporate power
and the political establishment. This reframes opposition from a
liability into a badge of honor, thereby strengthening the worldview of
The Compliant.1<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Recommendation 3: Strategic Communication for The
Compliant:</strong> To counter the Delusionist noise, the Greens must
refine their communication strategy. This means moving beyond abstract
policy points and using clear, relatable language that connects their
policies directly to the Extractive Evil that The Compliant feel every
day. For instance, campaigns should directly link corporate
super-profits to the high cost of living and stagnant wages, thereby
exposing the True Intent of the corporate lobbying that underpins the
political status quo.24<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Recommendation 4: A Proactive Stance on Internal
Conflict:</strong> The Greens must develop a transparent,
well-articulated framework for addressing internal ideological
conflicts. By acknowledging the tensions within the party and clearly
defining their resolution process, they can inoculate themselves against
Delusionist narratives that seek to frame such conflicts as a sign of
chaos and extremism, thereby protecting the integrity of their
worldview.3</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="a-roadmap-for-further-research"><strong>6.3 A Roadmap for
Further Research</strong></h4>
<p>The investigation into this sub-bucket is ongoing, and the following
areas are identified for further research to deepen the understanding of
the Minimisation Plan in Australia.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Research Bucket 1: The Delusionist Impact on Voter
Behaviour.</strong> Conduct a detailed psephological analysis to
determine the exact impact of Minimiser narratives on voter preference
flows. The research should specifically examine the correlation between
exposure to Minimiser-aligned media and the decline in Greens’
preferences from Labor voters. This would provide a quantitative measure
of the Minimisation Plan’s success in degrading the system.2<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Research Bucket 2: The International Minimisation of Green
Parties.</strong> Conduct a comparative analysis of the suppression of
Green parties in other Western nations. The research should seek to
identify common Minimiser tactical signatures, such as the Helxis Tensor
and manufactured justification playbooks, and evaluate the success of
various counter-narratives in a global context.29 This would allow for
the development of a more comprehensive, global counter-strategy.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Research Bucket 3: The Rhizomatic Nature of
Influence.</strong> Further investigate the financial and ideological
ties between the Cormack Foundation, the Centre for Independent Studies,
the Institute of Public Affairs, and Advance to understand how they
function as a cohesive network to promote Minimiser narratives and
policies in Australian politics.14 This would map the full extent of
the<br />
rhizomatic war and its key actors in the Australian theatre.</li>
