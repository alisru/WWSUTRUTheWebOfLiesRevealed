Permitted Fire: An Analysis of Strategic Inaction and Threat Triage in
the Australian Theatre</strong></h1>
<h2 id="section-i-executive-summary"><strong>Section I: Executive
Summary</strong></h2>
<p>This report presents a strategic analysis of the Australian
government’s response to the rise of domestic neo-Nazi actors, including
Thomas Sewell and the National Socialist Network (NSN). Evaluated
through the analytical frameworks of the Minimisation Plan and the
Psochic Hegemony, the evidence indicates that the government’s
permissive stance is not a failure of policy but a deliberate,
sophisticated strategy of “Compliance Management” and “Threat Triage.”
This strategy, while preserving the stability of the administrative
state, ultimately serves the long-term objectives of the Minimisation
Plan by allowing the degradation of Australia’s domestic social and
informational environment.</p>
<p>The government’s response to the violent activities of the NSN,
particularly the attack on the Camp Sovereignty Indigenous protest site,
was characterized by a minimalist approach of narrative management and
de-escalation. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s framing of rally
attendees as “good people” with “legitimate concerns” was a calculated
act designed to manage the allegiance of “The Compliant”—the
ideologically uncommitted majority—and prevent their permanent capture
by Minimiser actors.</p>
<p>This approach is one component of a broader “Threat Triage” doctrine,
which reveals a clear hierarchy of priorities. Threats targeting the
apparatus of the state, such as foreign-sponsored subversion, are met
with a maximalist and punitive response. Conversely, threats targeting
the social fabric, including domestic extremism and disinformation, are
met with permissive, managerial, or complicit inaction. This doctrine
prioritizes the integrity of the state over the health of society.</p>
<p>When mapped on the Psochic Hegemony, the government’s key strategies,
such as its weak misinformation legislation and its handling of domestic
extremism, consistently fall within the “Greater Lie” quadrant. They are
framed as proactive initiatives for the public good but function
extractively, draining social cohesion and public trust to achieve
narrow political objectives. The inaction against neo-Nazis is therefore
not an oversight but a functional component of a broader strategy to
manage dissent, neutralize political opponents, and maintain a chaotic
information environment conducive to the long-term goals of the
Minimisation Plan. Responsibility lies with an executive leadership
executing a sophisticated strategy of controlled demolition, which
prioritizes its own power and the stability of the state, even at the
cost of the nation’s democratic and social health.</p>
<h2 id="section-ii-the-anatomy-of-a-permitted-threat"><strong>Section
II: The Anatomy of a Permitted Threat</strong></h2>
<p>The Australian government’s response to domestic extremism cannot be
assessed in a vacuum. It must be understood in the context of the
tangible, violent threat posed by actors like Thomas Sewell and his
neo-Nazi organization, the National Socialist Network (NSN). Their
activities demonstrate a persistent vector of violence and social
division, against which the government’s subsequent actions represent a
deliberate strategic choice.</p>
<h3 id="event-reconstruction-march-for-australia-and-the-attack-on-camp-sovereignty"><strong>Event
Reconstruction: ‘March for Australia’ and the Attack on Camp
Sovereignty</strong></h3>
<p>On August 31, 2025, a series of anti-immigration rallies under the
banner “March for Australia” took place in cities across the nation.
These events were explicitly promoted by far-right political figures and
were directly linked to the NSN<a href="#citation-1">.1</a> In Melbourne, Thomas Sewell, the
established leader of the NSN, addressed the crowd from the steps of the
Victorian parliament to “huge cheers,” outlining a violent vision for
his followers in the “fight for [Australia’s] survival”<a href="#citation-1">.1</a></p>
<p>Following the rally, the event escalated from political speech to
organized violence. A group of approximately 50 men dressed in black,
including Sewell, stormed the nearby Camp Sovereignty, a long-standing
First Nations protest site and sacred space<a href="#citation-3">.3</a> The assault was unprovoked
and brutal. Assailants were filmed carrying “pipes, poles, and
branches,” stomping on a sacred fire, and physically assaulting those
present, appearing to specifically target women<a href="#citation-3">.3</a> The attack resulted in
multiple injuries; Ambulance Victoria confirmed a woman was hospitalized
for upper body injuries, and camp organizers reported that two people
were taken to hospital with severe head injuries<a href="#citation-3">.3</a> This sequence of
events establishes the incident not as a political protest that spiraled
out of control, but as a premeditated act of violent, targeted
intimidation.</p>
<h3 id="profile-of-the-threat-actor-thomas-sewell-and-the-nsn"><strong>Profile
of the Threat Actor: Thomas Sewell and the NSN</strong></h3>
<p>The government’s response was formulated with full knowledge of the
actors involved. Thomas Sewell is not a fringe commentator but a
self-appointed neo-Nazi leader with a documented history of promoting
white supremacy and engaging in violent criminal conduct<a href="#citation-6">.6</a> His criminal
record includes a prison sentence for a violent 2021 attack on hikers in
Victoria’s Cathedral Range and a guilty verdict for affray and
recklessly causing injury in a separate incident involving a Channel
Nine security guard<a href="#citation-6">.6</a> At the time of the Camp Sovereignty attack, Sewell
was already on bail for other alleged offenses, including the
intimidation of a police officer<a href="#citation-8">.8</a></p>
<p>Following the attack, Sewell was arrested and faced 25 charges,
including violent disorder, affray, and assault<a href="#citation-6">.6</a> During his bail
hearing, Victoria Police argued he posed an “unacceptable risk to
society,” citing his group’s “documented history of hate crimes” and the
risk of “serious injury or death” to anyone who opposed them<a href="#citation-10">.10</a> This
extensive public record of violent extremism is critical; it
demonstrates that the government was dealing with a known, recidivist
violent actor, rendering its subsequent de-escalatory response a
conscious strategic choice rather than a misjudgment based on incomplete
information.</p>
<h3 id="deconstructing-the-governments-response-the-good-people-gambit"><strong>Deconstructing
the Government’s Response: The “Good People” Gambit</strong></h3>
<p>In the aftermath of the rallies and the attack, Prime Minister
Anthony Albanese’s response was “notably nuanced and de-escalatory”<a href="#citation-1">.1</a> He
publicly downplayed the significance of the turnout, stating, “They
weren’t big numbers”<a href="#citation-1">.1</a> More significantly, he deliberately drew a
distinction between the extremist organizers and the thousands of
attendees. He asserted there was “no doubt” that “good people” had
attended the rallies, driven by “legitimate concerns” about the cost of
living and housing<a href="#citation-1">.1</a></p>
<p>Albanese explicitly warned against confrontational responses that
might push these individuals “further down that rabbit hole,” framing
the issue as one where vulnerable people were being manipulated by bad
actors, rather than one of inherent extremism among the attendees
themselves<a href="#citation-1">.1</a> This framing was a consciously chosen and potentially
controversial line, causing “notable unease” within the Labor
caucus<a href="#citation-1">.1</a></p>
<p>This was not a political gaffe but a sophisticated psychological
operation. The primary battleground of the Minimisation Plan is the
allegiance of “The Compliant”—the vast, ideologically uncommitted
segment of the population<a href="#citation-11">.11</a> A blanket condemnation of thousands of
rally-goers as racist would be a losing strategy, serving only to
alienate them and cement their shift towards Minimiser ideologies.
Albanese’s statement, by contrast, separates the</p>
<p><em>identity</em> of the person (“good people”) from their
<em>behavior</em> (attending a neo-Nazi-linked rally). It validates
their underlying grievances (“legitimate concerns”) while invalidating
the extremist channel they chose for their expression. This provides an
“off-ramp” for attendees to disavow the NSN’s leadership without having
to admit personal fault, allowing them to retreat to the political
center where Labor can then compete for their votes on those same
“legitimate concerns.” It was a calculated act of “Compliance
Management” that prioritized the political management of a key
demographic over direct ideological confrontation with extremism<a href="#citation-1">.1</a></p>
<h2 id="section-iii-the-doctrine-of-threat-triage"><strong>Section III:
The Doctrine of Threat Triage</strong></h2>
<p>The government’s permissive response to the NSN is not an isolated
incident but part of a consistent and calculated doctrine of “Threat
Triage.” This doctrine involves categorizing and responding to threats
based on their nature and their primary target, revealing a clear
hierarchy of priorities. This hierarchy consistently values the
integrity and security of the administrative state apparatus above the
health and cohesion of the domestic social fabric<a href="#citation-1">.1</a></p>
<h3 id="comparative-analysis-of-government-responses"><strong>Comparative
Analysis of Government Responses</strong></h3>
<p>A comparative analysis of the government’s actions against different
threats makes this doctrine undeniable:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Threat 1: Domestic Extremism (NSN):</strong> The response is
minimalist, characterized by “Narrative Management &amp; De-escalation.”
The strategic function is to manage the social fallout of extremist
actions and, crucially, to prevent the permanent alienation of “The
Compliant” faction, thereby maintaining social stability over
confronting ideology<a href="#citation-1">.1</a><br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Threat 2: State-Sponsored Subversion (Iran):</strong> The
response is maximalist, described as “Decisive &amp; Punitive.” When
intelligence indicated the Iranian regime had directed antisemitic
attacks on Australian soil, the government’s reaction was swift and
severe. It publicly accused the regime, expelled its envoy, and moved to
list the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist
organization. The stated justification was the protection of national
security, demonstrating a zero-tolerance policy for threats directed at
state sovereignty by another state actor<a href="#citation-1">.1</a><br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Threat 3: Domestic Political Disinformation (Advance
Australia):</strong> The response is one of passive complicity, or
“Strategic Silence.” The government has offered no public condemnation
of this well-funded, Minimiser-aligned group, even as it runs aggressive
disinformation campaigns against Labor’s political rivals, particularly
the Greens. This silence is electorally advantageous, allowing a proxy
to weaken an opponent while Labor maintains a veneer of civility<a href="#citation-1">.1</a><br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Threat 4: Corporate-Facilitated Misinformation (Social Media
Platforms):</strong> The response is permissive and co-regulatory. The
government’s proposed misinformation bill is a “Strategic Sponge” that
creates the <em>performance</em> of governance through committees and
consultations, but ultimately leaves platforms to regulate themselves.
This maintains the core infrastructure of Delusionism while absorbing
political pressure to act<a href="#citation-1">.1</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The stark disparity in these responses is visually codified in the
following matrix, which illustrates the government’s operational
priorities.</p>

</table>
<p>The pattern revealed by this matrix is unambiguous. The intensity of
the government’s response is directly proportional to the degree to
which a threat targets the apparatus of the state (sovereignty, security
agencies, international relations) and inversely proportional to threats
that target the social fabric (public discourse, social cohesion,
democratic norms).</p>
<p>This doctrine creates a dangerous symbiosis with the objectives of
the Minimisation Plan. The plan operates by manufacturing crises to
demonstrate that democracy is inherently chaotic and unworkable<a href="#citation-11">.11</a> One
of its core propaganda narratives is: “See how their freedom allows
Nazis and extremists to roam the streets”<a href="#citation-11">.11</a> By permitting the “fire” of
domestic extremism to burn, managed but never extinguished, the
government’s minimalist response provides the retroactive “evidence” for
the initial Minimiser lie. The government’s strategy, designed for
domestic political management, thus creates a self-fulfilling prophecy
that serves the strategic goals of the external actors orchestrating the
chaos. The state is preserved, but society is degraded—the ultimate
objective of the Minimisation Plan.</p>
<h2 id="section-iv-the-strategic-logic-of-inaction-managing-the-compliant"><strong>Section
IV: The Strategic Logic of Inaction: Managing ‘The
Compliant’</strong></h2>
<p>The rationale behind the Threat Triage doctrine is not rooted in
weakness or incompetence but in a calculated political strategy. The
government permits the fire of domestic extremism because its primary
objective is not to defeat the ideology but to manage the allegiance of
the great, uncommitted middle of the population, a faction the
Minimisation Plan framework identifies as the conflict’s center of
gravity: “The Compliant”<a href="#citation-11">.11</a></p>
<h3 id="the-compliant-as-the-center-of-gravity"><strong>‘The Compliant’
as the Center of Gravity</strong></h3>
<p>The Minimisation Plan posits that society is functionally divided
into three groups: Maximisers (who build), Minimisers (who destroy), and
The Compliant<a href="#citation-11">.11</a> The Compliant constitute the vast majority of the
population. They are not ideologically committed and will passively
align with whichever force appears more powerful or coherent. The entire
Minimisation Plan is a war for their allegiance<a href="#citation-11">.11</a> The thousands of
attendees at the “March for Australia” rallies, whom Prime Minister
Albanese labeled “good people,” are the physical embodiment of this
target demographic. They are motivated by real-world pressures like
housing and cost of living, and are therefore susceptible to Minimiser
narratives that blame external factors like immigration for their
problems<a href="#citation-1">.1</a></p>
<h3 id="inaction-as-a-compliance-management-strategy"><strong>Inaction
as a ‘Compliance Management’ Strategy</strong></h3>
<p>The government’s de-escalatory response to the rallies is explicitly
identified as a “Compliance Management” strategy<a href="#citation-1">.1</a> Its purpose is to
prevent the full capture of The Compliant by Minimiser actors. A harsh,
condemnatory crackdown on thousands of citizens could easily be framed
by extremists as an elite, out-of-touch government attacking ordinary
people for expressing their concerns. This would be a major propaganda
victory for the far-right, likely cementing the allegiance of many
attendees to their cause.</p>
<p>By separating the people from the ideology (“good people,”
“legitimate concerns”), the Prime Minister’s strategy aims to build a
bridge for these disaffected citizens to return to the mainstream
political discourse<a href="#citation-1">.1</a> It keeps them in a political space where the Labor
party can compete for their support on the basis of those same
“legitimate concerns,” rather than ceding them entirely to the extremist
fringe. This approach prioritizes social stability and the management of
political demographics over a direct and potentially alienating
confrontation with extremist ideology.</p>
<p>This specific tactic is consistent with the broader pattern of
“controlled demolition” identified in the government’s handling of the
Indigenous Voice to Parliament referendum<a href="#citation-12">.12</a> In that case, a “Maximiser”
policy was architected for failure to manufacture a divisive national
debate, exhaust progressive movements, and allow Labor to position
itself as the “sensible center.” Here, a “Minimiser” threat is
managed—not eliminated—for the same strategic purpose: to allow the
government to position itself as the only reasonable manager of a
chaotic society, distinct from the “extreme” right (NSN) and the
“unrealistic” left (Greens). The continued, low-level existence of the
threat becomes politically useful for a government seeking to
consolidate power in the center.</p>
<h2 id="section-v-mapping-the-deception-on-the-psochic-hegemony"><strong>Section
V: Mapping the Deception on the Psochic Hegemony</strong></h2>
<p>The government’s strategy can be formally mapped and its
deceptiveness quantified using the Psochic Hegemony framework<a href="#citation-13">.13</a> This
model assesses actions based on two axes: the Moral Question (</p>
<p>υ: Who benefits?) and the Volitional Question (ψ: What is its mode of
action?). Actions that are framed as a “Greater Good” (top-right
quadrant: +υ, +ψ) but whose true effect is extractive or destructive
(bottom-right quadrant: −υ, +ψ) are defined as a “Greater Lie.” The
distance between the framed vector and the true vector is a direct
measure of the action’s dishonesty<a href="#citation-13">.13</a></p>
<h3 id="case-study-1-the-misinformation-bill-as-a-strategic-sponge"><strong>Case
Study 1: The Misinformation Bill as a “Strategic Sponge”</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Framed Vector (+υ, +ψ):</strong> The <em>Communications
Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation)
Bill 2024</em> is publicly presented as a proactive (+ψ) move for the
“Greater Good” (+υ) of creating a safer online environment for all
Australians<a href="#citation-1">.1</a><br/>
</li>
<li><strong>True Vector (−υ, +ψ):</strong> The bill is proactive (+ψ) in
that it initiates a complex and lengthy process of public consultation
and parliamentary committees. However, its true function is extractive
(−υ). By explicitly prohibiting the regulator from removing content and
delegating enforcement back to the platforms, the bill maintains the
status quo<a href="#citation-1">.1</a> It functions as a “Strategic Sponge,” absorbing years of
political pressure, public concern, and activist energy. The outcome is
a drain on social cohesion and public trust, as the channels for
Minimiser influence remain open while democratic institutions appear
responsive but are ultimately ineffectual. The strategy preserves the
chaotic information environment that serves Minimiser objectives<a href="#citation-1">.1</a><br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The bill is a textbook “Greater Lie.”
The significant gap between its stated intent and its actual function
reveals a deliberate act of political deception<a href="#citation-1">.1</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="case-study-2-the-response-to-the-nsn"><strong>Case Study 2: The
Response to the NSN</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Framed Vector (+υ, +ψ):</strong> The government’s
de-escalatory response is framed as a proactive (+ψ) and wise act of
leadership for the “Greater Good” (+υ) of maintaining national unity,
promoting social harmony, and preventing the further radicalization of
vulnerable citizens<a href="#citation-1">.1</a><br/>
</li>
<li><strong>True Vector (−υ, +ψ):</strong> The response is proactive
(+ψ) in its sophisticated narrative management. However, its true
function is profoundly extractive (−υ). By refusing to take decisive
action to confront the ideology, it normalizes the presence of violent
extremists in public life. It extracts safety and security from targeted
communities—particularly First Nations and minority groups—and degrades
the quality of democratic discourse for the entire nation. It sacrifices
the collective’s long-term social health for the government’s narrow,
short-term political goal of managing a key demographic.<br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This response also maps squarely to the
“Greater Lie” quadrant. It is a deceptive strategy that prioritizes
political expediency over the fundamental responsibility to protect
citizens from hate-fueled violence.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two policies are not separate but represent a single, coherent
strategy operating on two fronts. The “Strategic Sponge” of the
misinformation bill creates a permissive <em>digital</em> environment
where hate and disinformation can flourish. The “Compliance Management”
strategy for the NSN creates a permissive <em>physical</em> environment
where the consequences of that online hate can manifest as real-world
violence. The failure to regulate the infrastructure of hate directly
enables the violence that the government then chooses to manage
permissively. This creates a self-sustaining loop that perfectly aligns
with the Minimisation Plan’s core philosophy of Delusionism, where the
goal is to create a state of strategic exhaustion and make the very
concept of “facts” irrelevant<a href="#citation-11">.11</a> The government’s strategy, designed to
maintain its own power, becomes the primary engine for the erosion of
the very democratic society it purports to lead.</p>
<h2 id="section-vi-conclusion-the-architecture-of-responsibility"><strong>Section
VI: Conclusion: The Architecture of Responsibility</strong></h2>
<p>The cumulative evidence, synthesized through the provided analytical
frameworks, leads to a coherent set of conclusions that directly address
the core questions of this investigation. The Australian government’s
failure to take decisive action against neo-Nazis like Thomas Sewell is
not an oversight, a weakness, or a miscalculation. It is the intended
outcome of a deliberate and sophisticated political strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Why is Australia not taking decisive action?</strong><br/>
Decisive action, such as the proscription of the NSN as a terrorist
organization or the unequivocal condemnation of its supporters, is not
being taken because inaction is the strategy. A direct confrontation
would disrupt the delicate political calculus of “Compliance
Management.” It would risk alienating a segment of “The Compliant” that
the government believes it can manage and eventually win over. The
government prioritizes the political management of the populace over the
ideological defeat of extremism. The existence of a managed, low-level
extremist threat also serves as a useful political foil, allowing the
government to position itself as the only “sensible” alternative to the
chaos on its right and the “ideological purity” on its left.<br/>
<strong>Who is responsible for allowing this?</strong><br/>
Responsibility lies with the executive leadership of the Australian
government, specifically with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who has
personally articulated and defended this strategy. The pattern of
behavior is too consistent across different policy domains to be
accidental. It is not a failure of the system but the successful
implementation of a top-down doctrine of “controlled demolition” and
“Threat Triage.” This doctrine dictates that the state’s administrative
stability and its international relationships are paramount, even if
protecting them comes at the expense of the domestic social
fabric.<br/>
<strong>What have people in power done in response?</strong><br/>
In response to neo-Nazi activities, people in power have engaged in
sophisticated narrative management, downplaying the scale of the threat,
making calculated appeals to the “legitimate concerns” of disaffected
citizens, and creating legislative “sponges” that absorb public pressure
for action while ensuring no substantive change occurs. They have
demonstrated a capacity for swift and decisive action, but have reserved
it exclusively for threats that directly challenge the apparatus of the
state.<br/>
<strong>How does this compare to their actions against threats that
oppose the Minimisation Plan?</strong><br/>
The comparison is stark and damning. Threats to social cohesion and
democratic norms, such as neo-Nazis and disinformation, are managed,
permitted, or even passively leveraged for political gain. In contrast,
threats to the state’s integrity, such as foreign-sponsored subversion,
are crushed. Political opponents who advance “Maximiser” policies that
challenge the status quo, such as the Greens, are strategically
undermined, sometimes with the tacit assistance of Minimiser-aligned
proxies like Advance Australia.<br/>
This reveals a government whose primary function is to preserve its own
power and the stability of the administrative state. By allowing the
internal social and informational environment to degrade, it
inadvertently—or deliberately—advances the core objectives of the
Minimisation Plan, which seeks to prove that liberal democracy is
unworkable. The permitted fire of extremism serves to burn away the
social trust and cohesion that are the true foundations of a healthy
democracy.</p>
