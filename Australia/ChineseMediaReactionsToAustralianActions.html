Australian Hum: A Timeline of Action and Reaction in the Sino-Centric
Narrative War, 2010-Present</strong></h1>
<h2
id="introduction-the-australian-theatre-in-the-rhizomatic-war"><strong>Introduction:
The Australian Theatre in the Rhizomatic War</strong></h2>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the Australia-China
relationship from 2010 to the present, examined through the strategic
framework of the “Minimisation Plan.” Australia serves as a critical
case study in this global influence campaign, representing a key “social
battlefield” where the inherent tensions of a Western liberal democracy
are exploited.1 The nation’s deep economic integration with the People’s
Republic of China (PRC), a primary director of the Minimisation Plan,
exists in direct conflict with its foundational security alliance with
the United States. This strategic dichotomy makes Australia a focal
point for the rhizomatic war, a multi-domain conflict fought not with
conventional weapons but with narratives designed to erode institutional
cohesion and sway the allegiance of the uncommitted majority, designated
herein as “The Compliant”.1</p>
<p>The analysis within this document utilizes the core conceptual tools
outlined in the foundational primers on the Minimisation Plan.1
Australian government actions are categorized according to their
strategic effect. “Maximiser” vectors are those policies and initiatives
that align with the principles of the “Greater Good”—constructive,
cooperative actions aimed at mutual benefit, such as forging new trade
agreements or participating in global climate initiatives. Conversely,
actions that are perceived by Beijing as antagonistic, divisive, or
strengthening alliances hostile to its interests are classified as
“Minimiser” vectors. These typically involve enhancing security ties
with the United States and its regional partners.1</p>
<p>The primary indicator of a Minimisation Plan counter-operation is the
detection of the “hum.” The “hum” is defined as the disproportionate,
often illogical, and strategically crafted reaction from Chinese
state-controlled media and official channels in response to a given
Australian action.1 The intensity, tone, and narrative content of this
“hum” are not arbitrary; they are calibrated signals that reveal the
strategic value the PRC places on the Australian action in question.
These reactions are mapped using the Psochic Hegemony model, which
assesses the moral and volitional nature of an idea or action.2
Maximiser actions, which seek to create new value for all, are plotted
in the proactive, universal-benefit quadrant (</p>
<p>+υ,+ψ). Minimiser actions, particularly those strengthening security
alliances, are consistently framed by the Chinese narrative apparatus as
extractive and suppressive (plotted in the −υ,−ψ quadrant), designed to
take from others and prevent China’s rise.2</p>
<p>The objective of this report is to construct a definitive timeline of
this action-reaction chain. By cataloging Australian Maximiser and
Minimiser vectors and meticulously analyzing the corresponding Chinese
“hum,” this document identifies the consistent playbook of narratives
deployed by Beijing. This analysis demonstrates how these narratives are
used to manage the bilateral relationship, influence the Australian body
politic, and ultimately advance the Minimisation Plan’s long-term goal
of systematically eroding the cohesion of Western democracies.1</p>

id="part-i-the-gillard-rudd-era-2010-2013---the-duality-of-engagement"><strong>Part
I: The Gillard-Rudd Era (2010-2013) - The Duality of
Engagement</strong></h2>
<p>The period of governance under Prime Minister Julia Gillard, which
also includes the brief second term of Kevin Rudd, is defined by a
fundamental duality in its approach to the People’s Republic of China.
On one hand, the Gillard government pursued deep economic and diplomatic
engagement, representing clear Maximiser vectors aimed at fostering
cooperation. On the other, it simultaneously undertook significant
actions to strengthen Australia’s security alliance with the United
States, which were perceived by Beijing as potent Minimiser vectors.3
This policy dichotomy produced a fluctuating “hum” from Beijing’s
state-controlled media, offering a clear and invaluable baseline for
understanding how the PRC calibrates its narrative response. The
reactions during this era established the foundational themes of reward
for economic cooperation and punishment for security alignment that
would dominate the relationship for the next decade.</p>
<h3
id="subsection-1.1-maximiser-vector---the-carbon-pricing-mechanism-2012"><strong>Subsection
1.1: Maximiser Vector - The Carbon Pricing Mechanism
(2012)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Australian Action:</strong> In February 2011, the Gillard
government announced its plan to legislate a carbon pricing scheme,
which was enacted as the Clean Energy Act 2011 and came into effect on 1
July 2012.4 This market-based mechanism was designed to combat climate
change by imposing a price on carbon pollution for Australia’s largest
emitters.5 Within the analytical framework of the Minimisation Plan,
this policy represents a quintessential “Maximiser” vector. It is an
action aimed at the “Greater Good,” aligning with global cooperative
efforts to address a shared existential threat and promoting a more
sustainable economic model.1</p>
<p><strong>Chinese “Hum”:</strong> The direct reaction from official
Chinese state media to Australia’s carbon price was notably subdued and
pragmatic, in stark contrast to the heated domestic debate within
Australia. The available evidence indicates that Beijing viewed the
policy not as a threat, but as a valuable case study. There was a keen
interest within Chinese policy circles in learning from Australia’s
experience as the PRC contemplated its own emissions reduction
strategies.6 During a visit to Australia, Vice Chairman Xie of China’s
National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the country’s
effective climate change minister, highlighted the “great potential for
cooperation” between the two nations on this front and expressed that
“China is willing to be open, frank and pragmatic and to exchange views
and experiences”.6 This response constitutes a low-intensity, positive
“hum” of encouragement and engagement, signaling that this particular
Maximiser action was viewed favorably by Beijing.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The Chinese reaction reveals a pragmatic
and opportunistic approach. By framing Australia’s policy as a useful
experiment, Beijing signaled its approval of this type of “Maximiser”
action without committing to a similar path. This cooperative posture
stands in sharp relief to the domestic Australian reaction, which was a
textbook “Minimiser” counter-operation. As detailed in the
<em>Investigative Primer</em>, a relentless media campaign, particularly
by News Limited papers, successfully branded the policy a “carbon tax”.1
This campaign, funded by mining interests whose primary customer is
China, was disproportionate and highly effective in turning public
opinion—The Compliant—against the measure, ultimately leading to its
repeal.1</p>
<p>The simultaneous operation of these two distinct “hums”—one positive
and external, the other negative and internal—is a critical
demonstration of the rhizomatic nature of the Minimisation Plan.1 The
plan can operate on multiple fronts at once, often in seemingly
contradictory ways. The Chinese state, as the external director,
maintained a cooperative and respectable public stance, thereby
preserving diplomatic goodwill and its image as a responsible global
actor. Concurrently, domestic Australian actors whose financial
interests were directly aligned with the PRC’s (specifically, the
uninterrupted and low-cost export of resources) executed a highly
disruptive internal narrative campaign. This two-pronged strategy
allowed the Minimisation Plan to achieve its tactical objective—the
elimination of a policy that would have increased the cost of Australian
resources—without the state actor being overtly implicated in an act of
hostile foreign interference. This dynamic perfectly illustrates the
“Unbelievability Cloak,” where the sheer audacity and
compartmentalization of the operation make it difficult for observers to
connect the dots and recognize the coordinated nature of the
campaign.1</p>
<h3
id="subsection-1.2-minimiser-vector---us-marines-in-darwin-november-2011"><strong>Subsection
1.2: Minimiser Vector - US Marines in Darwin (November
2011)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Australian Action:</strong> In November 2011, during a visit
by US President Barack Obama, Prime Minister Gillard announced an
agreement to station US Marines on a rotational basis in Darwin, the
capital of Australia’s Northern Territory.3 This decision was a central
component of the Obama administration’s “Pivot to Asia,” a strategic
rebalancing of US military and diplomatic assets toward the region.3
From the perspective of the Minimisation Plan framework, this is a
quintessential “Minimiser” vector. It is a direct and material
enhancement of the US-Australia military alliance, projecting American
power into China’s immediate sphere of influence and strengthening the
security architecture that Beijing perceives as a primary obstacle to
its regional ambitions.1</p>
<p><strong>Chinese “Hum”:</strong> The reaction from Beijing was
immediate, coordinated, and hostile, marking the first major instance in
this timeline of what would become a cornerstone narrative of the
Chinese “hum”: <strong>encirclement</strong>. The Chinese Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MFA) publicly criticized the move as “inappropriate”
and asserted that it was “not … in the interest of countries within this
region”.3 The state-controlled media amplified this official displeasure
with more pointed and aggressive language. The</p>
<p><em>Global Times</em>, a nationalistic tabloid published by the
Communist Party’s <em>People’s Daily</em>, warned that Australia “cannot
play China for a fool” and now risked being “caught in the crossfire” of
a potential conflict between the US and China.3 A military analyst, Li
Jie, writing in the</p>
<p><em>Global Times</em>, provided the most explicit articulation of the
encirclement narrative. He stated that the US base in Darwin would
operate in conjunction with existing bases in Japan, South Korea, and
Guam, and concluded with devastating bluntness: “It is moving toward
encircling China”.11 This narrative was designed to frame a defensive
alliance posture as an aggressive act of containment.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The “encirclement hum” serves two primary
strategic purposes for the Minimisation Plan. First, it functions as a
tool of “manufactured justification”.1 By framing any enhancement of the
US alliance system as an act of aggression, Beijing creates a public
pretext for its own military expansion and assertive behavior in
contested areas like the South China Sea. The narrative effectively
shifts the blame for rising regional tensions onto the US and its
allies, portraying China’s actions as a necessary and defensive response
to Western provocation. Second, this narrative is aimed at creating
division within the region. It seeks to persuade neighboring
countries—The Compliant on a regional scale—that Australia is not an
independent actor but a proxy for American aggression, a destabilizing
force that invites great power conflict into their backyard.12</p>
<p>This event provides a clear example of how the Minimisation Plan
manufactures the very problems it claims to be reacting to. The script
is consistent: “Look how their alliances create tension and provoke
conflict,” a narrative that is deployed while the PRC is simultaneously
engaged in its own unprecedented military buildup and the creation of
artificial islands in the South China Sea.1 The Darwin deployment, a
relatively small rotational force, was seized upon and amplified by the
Chinese media apparatus. It provided the perfect raw material to
construct and disseminate a powerful narrative of decay, allowing
Beijing to paint itself as the victim of a hostile Western containment
strategy, thereby justifying its subsequent actions to a domestic and
international audience.</p>
<h3
id="subsection-1.3-minimiser-vector---huawei-nbn-ban-early-2012"><strong>Subsection
1.3: Minimiser Vector - Huawei NBN Ban (Early 2012)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Australian Action:</strong> In early 2012, the Gillard
government made the decision to ban the Chinese telecommunications
corporation Huawei from tendering for contracts to build Australia’s
National Broadband Network (NBN).14 The decision was made on the grounds
of national security, following advice from the Australian Security
Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) regarding concerns that Huawei’s
equipment could compromise the integrity of this critical national
infrastructure.3 This was a direct “Minimiser” action, prioritizing
sovereign security and the integrity of digital infrastructure over the
potential economic benefits of engaging with a key Chinese corporate
champion.</p>
<p><strong>Chinese “Hum”:</strong> While direct, official government
quotes from 2012 are limited in the available materials, the pattern of
the “hum” is clear and consistent with later, more public reactions. The
decision led to a significant increase in bilateral tensions.3
Crucially, sources within Huawei communicated to the media that the
Chinese government would “retaliate against Australia if the ban on the
company’s participation is not lifted”.16 This introduction of a direct
threat of economic coercion is a key feature of the Minimiser “hum.” The
accompanying narrative, which would be heavily amplified in subsequent
years, was that the decision was not based on legitimate security
concerns but was a form of politically motivated discrimination against
a Chinese company.17 This narrative was supported by figures such as
Alexander Downer, a former Australian foreign minister and then-board
member of Huawei Australia, who dismissed the security concerns as
“ridiculous” and based solely on the fact that “the company being
Chinese”.14</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The “hum” in response to the NBN ban
combines two core narrative tactics: the threat of economic punishment
and a narrative of victimhood. The objective of this dual approach is to
reframe a sovereign national security decision as an unfair,
protectionist, and potentially Sinophobic act of economic warfare. The
threat of retaliation is designed to directly pressure Australian
policymakers by creating a tangible economic cost for their decision.
Simultaneously, the victimhood narrative is aimed at influencing The
Compliant, particularly within the Australian business and technology
sectors, who may be more inclined to view the security concerns as
overblown and who would bear the brunt of any retaliatory measures. By
portraying Huawei as a victim of irrational prejudice, the “hum” seeks
to build a domestic constituency within Australia that will advocate for
a reversal of the policy, thereby serving Beijing’s interests.</p>
<h3
id="subsection-1.4-maximiser-vector---the-strategic-partnership-april-2013"><strong>Subsection
1.4: Maximiser Vector - The Strategic Partnership (April
2013)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Australian Action:</strong> In April 2013, during a state
visit to China, Prime Minister Gillard secured a significant diplomatic
upgrade in the bilateral relationship, establishing a “strategic
partnership” (战略伙伴关系).3 This agreement was a landmark achievement,
creating a formal architecture for high-level dialogue, including annual
meetings between the Australian prime minister and the Chinese premier,
as well as between other key economic and foreign affairs ministers.18
This action elevated Australia to a diplomatic level with Beijing on par
with major powers like Russia and the UK, and was a clear “Maximiser”
vector aimed at fostering deep cooperation, mutual respect, and
institutionalized dialogue.3</p>
<p><strong>Chinese “Hum”:</strong> The official Chinese reaction was
overwhelmingly positive and widely publicized. The establishment of the
partnership was officially hailed as raising the bilateral relationship
to a “new level” and marking “milestones” in its development.18 During
his meeting with Gillard, newly appointed President Xi Jinping spoke of
fostering a strategic partnership built upon “mutual trust and mutual
benefit”.20 The official statements from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
and reports in state media were uniformly laudatory, creating a powerful
“hum” of reward and encouragement.18 This positive narrative was so
effective that the achievement garnered near-universal praise for
Gillard within Australian policy and media circles.3</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Beijing’s response to the Strategic
Partnership serves as a canonical example of a reward-based “hum.” The
entire state media apparatus was mobilized to amplify the message that
deep diplomatic and economic engagement is the correct and most
beneficial path for Australia to pursue. This narrative is aimed
squarely at The Compliant in Australia—policymakers, business leaders,
and the public—reinforcing the idea that cooperation with China brings
status, benefits, and international recognition.</p>
<p>The pattern that emerges from the Gillard era is a deliberate and
calculated strategy of behavioral conditioning. The stark contrast
between the hostile, threatening “hum” that followed the “Minimiser”
actions of the Darwin deployment and the Huawei ban, and the effusive,
laudatory “hum” that followed the “Maximiser” action of the Strategic
Partnership, is not coincidental. It reveals a deliberate strategy to
create a clear cost-benefit structure for Australian policy choices. The
implicit message communicated to The Compliant is simple and powerful:
alignment with the United States on security matters brings conflict,
tension, and regional instability. In contrast, deep engagement with
China on diplomatic and economic terms brings praise, elevated status,
and mutual prosperity. This represents a long-term narrative campaign
designed to gradually pull Australia’s strategic orientation away from
its traditional alliance with Washington and into a closer orbit around
Beijing, a core objective of the Minimisation Plan in the Australian
theatre.</p>

id="part-ii-the-abbott-government-2013-2015---fear-greed-and-the-japanese-quasi-alliance"><strong>Part
II: The Abbott Government (2013-2015) - Fear, Greed, and the Japanese
‘Quasi-Alliance’</strong></h2>
<p>The prime ministership of Tony Abbott was characterized by stark and
often jarring contradictions in its China policy. On one hand, the
Abbott government pursued the ultimate “Maximiser” economic objective:
the finalization of the long-stalled China-Australia Free Trade
Agreement (ChAFTA).21 On the other, it engaged in a series of
“Minimiser” security and diplomatic actions that provoked an intensely
hostile and personal “hum” from Beijing, most notably through its
significant strengthening of the strategic relationship with Japan.23
This period is perhaps best encapsulated by Abbott’s own leaked private
comment to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, in which he described
Australia’s China policy as being driven by “fear and greed”.23 This
moment of accidental candor perfectly articulated the core strategic
dilemma that the Minimisation Plan is designed to exploit: the tension
between economic opportunity and security anxiety.</p>
<h3
id="subsection-2.1-maximiser-vector---the-china-australia-free-trade-agreement-chafta-finalized-2014-signed-2015"><strong>Subsection
2.1: Maximiser Vector - The China-Australia Free Trade Agreement
(ChAFTA) (Finalized 2014, Signed 2015)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Australian Action:</strong> After nearly a decade of stalled
negotiations under previous governments, the Abbott government
designated the finalization of a comprehensive free trade agreement with
China as a primary foreign policy objective.23 Following his first
meeting with President Xi Jinping in October 2013, Abbott declared his
intention to conclude the deal within twelve months.23 This intensive
effort, led by Trade Minister Andrew Robb, culminated in the conclusion
of negotiations in November 2014 and the formal signing of the
China-Australia Free Trade Agreement (ChAFTA) in Canberra on 17 June
2015.22 This agreement was the single most significant “Maximiser”
economic action of the decade, designed to dramatically liberalize trade
and investment between the two nations.21</p>
<p><strong>Chinese “Hum”:</strong> The official Chinese “hum” in
response to the finalization and signing of ChAFTA was euphoric. The
reaction represented the apex of positive narrative reinforcement from
Beijing. In a congratulatory message, President Xi Jinping hailed the
agreement as a “paradigm of regional economic integration” and a
testament to the “fruitful results in economic and trade cooperation”
between the two countries.30 Official state media outlets like</p>
<p><em>Xinhua</em> and the <em>People’s Daily</em> celebrated ChAFTA as
a “landmark” and “historic” agreement that was “proof of Australia’s
trust in China”.30 The Chinese government’s official statement
highlighted that, of all FTAs involving China, this one boasted “the
highest level of overall trade and investment liberalization”.31 Even
the typically more hawkish</p>
<p><em>Global Times</em> reported positively, noting the “fruitful
outcomes” and the potential for upgraded cooperation under the
agreement.32 This was the “hum” at its most powerful and positive, a
clear and unambiguous signal of reward for Australia’s commitment to
deep economic integration.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The response to ChAFTA serves as the
canonical example of a reward-based “hum” within the Minimisation Plan’s
playbook. Beijing utilized its entire state media apparatus to amplify a
single, coherent message: deep economic partnership is the correct, most
beneficial, and most valued path for Australia. This narrative was aimed
squarely at The Compliant, especially the Australian business community
and economic policymakers, powerfully reinforcing the “greed” component
of Abbott’s “fear and greed” dichotomy. The overwhelming positivity of
the “hum” was designed to create a strong domestic incentive structure
within Australia, encouraging political and business leaders to
prioritize economic opportunities with China above other considerations,
particularly those related to security.</p>
<h3
id="subsection-2.2-minimiser-vector---strengthening-australia-japan-defense-ties"><strong>Subsection
2.2: Minimiser Vector - Strengthening Australia-Japan Defense
Ties</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Australian Action:</strong> In parallel with its pursuit of
ChAFTA, the Abbott government undertook a significant and highly public
deepening of its strategic and defense relationship with Japan. Foreign
Minister Julie Bishop repeatedly referred to Japan as Australia’s “best
friend in Asia” and endorsed Japan’s military modernization program, a
policy that China vigorously opposed.23 This strategic alignment
culminated in a deeply symbolic and, from Beijing’s perspective, highly
provocative moment in July 2014. During an address to the Australian
parliament attended by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Tony Abbott
praised the “skill and the sense of honour” of Japanese submariners who
were killed during a raid on Sydney Harbour in 1942.34 This act of
strengthening ties with a key regional rival and major US ally, combined
with what was perceived as a whitewashing of Japan’s wartime history,
constituted a powerful “Minimiser” vector.</p>
<p><strong>Chinese “Hum”:</strong> The “hum” from Beijing was immediate,
intensely personal, and vitriolic. It represented a shift from the
strategic and geopolitical criticism seen during the Gillard era to a
narrative based on moral outrage and historical grievance. China’s
official news agency, <em>Xinhua</em>, slammed Abbott’s remarks as
“appalling and insensible,” and took the deliberate step of reminding
its audience that the “skills” of the Japanese military also included
the “skills to loot, to rape, to torture and to kill”.23 The commentary
explicitly stated that Abbott’s praise was insensitive to the millions
who suffered under Japanese aggression.34 The</p>
<p><em>Global Times</em> was even more aggressive and ad hominem. An
English-language editorial dismissed Abbott’s remarks as an “outrage”
and, in a classic whataboutism tactic, attacked Australia’s own human
rights record, stating its history was “not short of records of human
rights infringement on the Aboriginal population”.35 The
Chinese-language version of the same editorial was more blunt, referring
to Australia’s “filthy record” and labeling Foreign Minister Julie
Bishop an “idiot” for her own comments about China.35</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> This incident provides a clear example of
the “hum” being weaponized through the selective use of historical
grievance. By invoking the atrocities of World War II, Beijing reframed
Australia’s contemporary strategic alignment with Japan not as a
pragmatic foreign policy choice, but as a profound moral failing and a
direct insult to the victims of Japanese imperialism, chief among them
China. This narrative is designed to be emotionally potent, to drive a
wedge between Australia and its Asian neighbors, and to isolate Canberra
by painting it as historically ignorant and morally bankrupt.</p>
<p>The contrast between the reactions to ChAFTA and the Japan
relationship reveals a sophisticated hierarchy within the Minimisation
Plan’s narrative playbook. The response is not monolithic; it is
tailored to the specific perceived offense. The US alliance is treated
as a strategic threat, so the “hum” is geopolitical, centered on themes
of “encirclement” and “Cold War mentality.” The Japan alliance, however,
was framed as a moral offense, allowing for the deployment of a more
visceral and historical “hum” centered on themes of “insulting victims”
and ignoring war crimes. The strategic “hum” aims to make Australia
appear to be a foolish pawn in America’s game. The moral “hum” aims to
make Australia appear to be an amoral actor, callously disregarding the
deep wounds of regional history. Both narratives serve the same ultimate
goal: to delegitimize Australia’s sovereign foreign policy choices in
the eyes of The Compliant, both domestically and across the region. This
demonstrates a nuanced understanding of narrative warfare, where the
line of attack is chosen not randomly, but for its maximum potential to
generate outrage, confusion, and division. The personal and historical
nature of the attack on Abbott was chosen because it was the most potent
weapon available in that specific context.</p>

III: The Turnbull Government (2015-2018) - Erecting the Digital and
Sovereign Firewalls</strong></h2>
<p>The prime ministership of Malcolm Turnbull marked a significant
turning point in Australia’s strategic posture towards the People’s
Republic of China. While the economic relationship established by ChAFTA
continued to be a central pillar, the government’s policy focus shifted
decisively towards countering perceived internal and external threats
emanating from Beijing.36 This period was defined by the introduction of
foundational “Minimiser” legislation and landmark decisions designed to
protect Australia’s sovereignty and critical infrastructure. These
actions elicited a coordinated, sustained, and increasingly hostile
“hum” from Beijing, which began to systematically deploy a narrative
playbook aimed at delegitimizing Australia’s defensive measures as acts
of prejudice and aggression.</p>
<h3
id="subsection-3.1-minimiser-vector---foreign-interference-legislation-2017-2018"><strong>Subsection
3.1: Minimiser Vector - Foreign Interference Legislation
(2017-2018)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Australian Action:</strong> In December 2017, the Turnbull
government introduced a comprehensive package of legislation aimed at
countering foreign interference and espionage. Announcing the new laws,
Prime Minister Turnbull explicitly referenced “disturbing reports about
Chinese influence” as a key motivator for the reforms.37 The legislation
included a ban on foreign political donations and created a transparency
scheme requiring individuals and entities acting on behalf of foreign
powers to register publicly.38 This was a direct and unprecedented
“Minimiser” action, a sovereign move to harden Australia’s democratic
institutions against the covert influence operations central to the
Minimisation Plan.</p>
<p><strong>Chinese “Hum”:</strong> Beijing’s reaction was a swift and
coordinated campaign of furious denial and counter-accusation. The
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman urged Australia to “discard
prejudice” and dismissed the concerns as being based on reports that
were “made up out of thin air and filled with cold war mentality and
ideological bias”.38 The Chinese Embassy in Canberra escalated the
rhetoric, accusing the Australian government and media of whipping up
“anti-China hysteria” and engaging in “paranoid” behavior.39 A
particularly sharp point of contention was Turnbull’s use of the phrase,
“the Australian people stand up,” delivered in both English and
Mandarin. This was a deliberate co-opting of a phrase attributed to Mao
Zedong upon the founding of the PRC, which symbolized the end of a
“century of humiliation” and foreign occupation. Beijing perceived this
as a profound and deliberate insult, and the remark was met with “fury”
in official and academic circles in China.40</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The “hum” deployed in response to the
foreign interference laws is a classic example of a Minimiser narrative
tactic: the <strong>“Victimhood Reversal.”</strong> In this maneuver,
the actor accused of malign activity (China) aggressively reframes
itself as the victim of baseless, prejudiced, and irrational
accusations. The narrative’s goal is to shift the focus away from the
evidence of interference and onto the alleged motives of those proposing
the defensive measures. By labeling the legislation as a product of
“hysteria,” “prejudice,” and a “Cold War mentality,” the “hum” seeks to
delegitimize the laws themselves. This is a powerful tactic designed to
influence The Compliant by making the act of defending sovereign
institutions appear to be an act of bigotry or xenophobia, thereby
silencing legitimate debate and creating political pressure to weaken or

3.2: Minimiser Vector - Huawei &amp; ZTE 5G Ban (August
2018)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Australian Action:</strong> In August 2018, the Turnbull
government formally announced that telecommunications companies “who are
likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign
government” would be banned from participating in Australia’s 5G mobile
network rollout.17 While not naming the companies explicitly, the
directive effectively banned Chinese firms Huawei and ZTE from the
project. This decision, building on the precedent of the 2012 NBN ban,
was a critical “Minimiser” vector aimed at securing Australia’s future
critical communications infrastructure from potential foreign state
control.42</p>
<p><strong>Chinese “Hum”:</strong> The “hum” was immediate, intense, and
followed a now well-established script. The Chinese Foreign Ministry
expressed “serious concerns” and demanded that the Australian government
“abandon ideological prejudices and provide a fair competitive
environment for Chinese companies”.41 The Ministry of Commerce issued a
statement warning Australia not to “easily interfere with and restrict
normal business activities in the name of national security”.42 The</p>
<p><em>Global Times</em> provided the most aggressive rhetoric,
publishing an English-language editorial titled “Canberra stabs Huawei
in the back,” which contained a direct threat: “those who wilfully hurt
Chinese companies with an excuse of national security will meet their
nemesis”.42 In subsequent commentary, the Chinese Ambassador to
Australia, Cheng Jingye, consistently framed the ban as being
“politically motivated” and a clear act of “discrimination against the
Chinese company”.17</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The “hum” surrounding the 5G ban
solidified the narrative playbook that Beijing deploys in response to
technology-related “Minimiser” actions. This multi-pronged narrative
strategy is designed to attack the decision from every conceivable
angle—moral, political, and economic—in order to maximize pressure on
the target government and sway the opinion of The Compliant. The key
themes of this playbook are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Denial of Security Risk:</strong> The complete dismissal of
legitimate, intelligence-based security concerns as unfounded and
unproven.41<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Accusation of Prejudice:</strong> The reframing of a
strategic decision as one based on ideology, protectionism, or
Sinophobia, rather than a rational assessment of risk.44<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Threat of Retaliation:</strong> The explicit or implicit
warning of negative economic consequences, using loaded terms like
“nemesis” to signal that a price will be paid.42<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Appeal to Consumer Interest:</strong> The argument that the
decision is ultimately self-harming, as it will deny Australian
businesses and consumers access to superior technology and lead to
higher prices due to a lack of competition.41</li>
</ol>
<p>This comprehensive narrative attack demonstrates the sophistication
of the Minimisation Plan’s information warfare capabilities. It is not
merely a reactive complaint but a proactive campaign to shape the
information environment, create domestic division, and impose a
political cost for policies that run counter to Beijing’s strategic
interests.</p>

IV: The Morrison Government (2018-2022) - The Hum at Maximum
Volume</strong></h2>
<p>The prime ministership of Scott Morrison represents the nadir of
modern Australia-China relations and the period in which the hostile
“hum” from Beijing reached its peak intensity and volume. A series of
high-profile “Minimiser” actions undertaken by the Morrison government
were met with unprecedented rhetorical hostility from Chinese officials
and state media. Crucially, this period saw the Minimisation Plan
escalate beyond narrative warfare into overt and widespread economic
coercion, demonstrating the final and most punitive stage of the
action-reaction chain.45 The “hum” was no longer just a signal of
displeasure; it became the direct prelude to tangible punishment.</p>
<h3
id="subsection-4.1-minimiser-vector---the-covid-19-inquiry-call-april-2020"><strong>Subsection
4.1: Minimiser Vector - The COVID-19 Inquiry Call (April
2020)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Australian Action:</strong> In April 2020, as the COVID-19
pandemic was escalating globally, Prime Minister Scott Morrison became
the first world leader to publicly and persistently call for an
independent international inquiry into the origins of the virus.46 While
the Australian government framed this as a reasonable and necessary
public health measure to prevent future pandemics, it was perceived in
Beijing as a direct political attack, a “Minimiser” vector designed to
assign blame to China for the global crisis and align Australia with the
more confrontational stance of the United States.48</p>
<p><strong>Chinese “Hum”:</strong> The reaction from Beijing was
extraordinarily hostile, personal, and derogatory. The Chinese
Ambassador to Australia, Cheng Jingye, took the unusual step of publicly
threatening a widespread consumer boycott, suggesting that ordinary
Chinese people might ask, “‘Why should we drink Australian wine? Eat
Australian beef?’”.46 This threat was immediately amplified by the state
media apparatus. The editor of the</p>
<p><em>Global Times</em>, Hu Xijin, published an infamous and widely
circulated comment describing Australia as “gum stuck on the sole of
China’s shoes. Sometimes you have to find a stone to rub it off”.47 The
paper accused Australia of “panda bashing,” “victim blaming,” and
engaging in “adventurism” that could damage the bilateral relationship
“beyond repair”.48 This intensely derogatory “hum” was not merely
rhetorical; it was immediately followed by concrete action. China
suspended imports from four major Australian beef abattoirs and moved to
impose crippling anti-dumping tariffs of over 80% on Australian barley,
directly linking the narrative attack to economic punishment.49</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> This sequence of events provides the
clearest available example of the “hum” functioning as a direct
precursor to economic warfare. The shift in language from the strategic
or political (e.g., “Cold War mentality”) to the openly derogatory and
dehumanizing (“gum on shoe”) was a critical signal. This was not just an
insult; it was a strategic act of delegitimization, designed to justify
the subsequent economic coercion to both a domestic Chinese audience and
the international community. It established a narrative in which
Australia was not a responsible global citizen seeking answers, but an
insignificant and irritating pest that deserved to be punished.</p>
<p>This episode reveals a clear escalation ladder within the
Minimisation Plan’s operational doctrine. For years, the “hum” in
response to “Minimiser” actions had consisted of hostile rhetoric and
veiled or explicit <em>threats</em> of retaliation. The call for a
COVID-19 inquiry, however, was perceived as such a significant and
politically sensitive challenge that it triggered an escalation from the
information domain to the economic domain. The intensity and nature of
the “hum” can therefore be used as a predictive indicator. The
transition from strategic language to openly contemptuous and
dehumanizing language signaled that a critical threshold had been
crossed and that kinetic action—in this case, economic—was imminent.
This provides a crucial diagnostic tool for analysts seeking to
anticipate the PRC’s responses to future provocations.</p>

id="subsection-4.2-minimiser-vector---the-aukus-pact-september-2021"><strong>Subsection
4.2: Minimiser Vector - The AUKUS Pact (September 2021)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Australian Action:</strong> In September 2021, the Morrison
government, alongside the United States and the United Kingdom,
announced the formation of the AUKUS security pact. The centerpiece of
the agreement was a plan for Australia to acquire a fleet of
conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarines.51 This was arguably
the most significant “Minimiser” military and strategic action taken by
Australia in the post-Cold War era, cementing its defense posture and
technological integration within the US alliance system for decades to
come.</p>
<p><strong>Chinese “Hum”:</strong> The “hum” from Beijing was severe,
sustained, and multi-faceted, representing a masterclass in Minimiser
narrative deployment. The Chinese Foreign Ministry immediately condemned
the pact, accusing the three nations of “seriously undermining regional
peace and stability, intensifying the arms race and undermining
international non-proliferation efforts”.51 The spokesperson labeled the
transfer of nuclear submarine technology to a non-nuclear state as
“extremely irresponsible”.52 The</p>
<p><em>Global Times</em> provided the most bellicose commentary, framing
AUKUS as an “Anglo-Saxon clique” driven by an “obsolete cold war zero
sum mentality”.52 It also issued a direct and chilling threat, warning
that if Australia acted assertively, “Australian troops are also most
likely to be the first batch of western soldiers to waste their lives in
the South China Sea”.52 The narrative that Australia was merely a “pawn”
of the United States, sacrificing its sovereignty for American
interests, was also heavily pushed.53</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The AUKUS “hum” was a comprehensive
information campaign designed to attack the pact from multiple angles
and discredit it in the eyes of different audiences. The key narrative
lines included:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>The Nuclear Proliferation Scare:</strong> A narrative aimed
at alarming non-nuclear states in Southeast Asia and the Pacific (The
Compliant), suggesting AUKUS violated the spirit of the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty and set a dangerous precedent.51<br />
</li>
<li><strong>The Arms Race Accusation:</strong> A classic blame-shifting
tactic designed to portray Australia, the US, and the UK as the
aggressors responsible for the militarization of the Indo-Pacific
region.52<br />
</li>
<li><strong>The Racial/Cultural Framing:</strong> The deliberate use of
the term “Anglo-Saxon clique” was an attempt to racially and culturally
isolate the AUKUS partners from the diverse nations of Asia, painting
the pact as a relic of colonial-era power dynamics.52<br />
</li>
<li><strong>The US Puppetry Narrative:</strong> The recurring theme that
Australia lacks strategic autonomy and is being drawn into potential
conflicts at the behest of Washington.53<br />
</li>
<li><strong>The Direct Threat of Violence:</strong> The explicit warning
of Australian military casualties, a stark escalation in rhetoric
designed to intimidate the Australian public and policymakers.52</li>
</ol>
<p>This multi-layered “hum” demonstrates a sophisticated effort to shape
the regional information environment against AUKUS, leveraging fears of
nuclear proliferation, arms races, and great power conflict to undermine
the pact’s legitimacy.</p>

id="subsection-4.3-minimiser-vector---diplomatic-boycott-of-beijing-winter-olympics-december-2021"><strong>Subsection
4.3: Minimiser Vector - Diplomatic Boycott of Beijing Winter Olympics
(December 2021)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Australian Action:</strong> In December 2021, the Morrison
government announced it would join the United States in a diplomatic
boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. The decision was explicitly
linked to concerns over “human rights abuses in Xinjiang” and Beijing’s
refusal to engage in dialogue with Australian officials on these
issues.55 This was a “Minimiser” action in the diplomatic and moral
domain, designed to signal disapproval of the PRC’s internal policies on
a major international stage.</p>
<p><strong>Chinese “Hum”:</strong> The “hum” in response to the boycott
was one of carefully performative dismissal and ridicule. The official
Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, tersely stated, “Whether
they come or not, nobody cares”.55 The Chinese Embassy in Canberra
echoed this, accusing Australian politicians of “political posturing”
and suggesting that they had not been invited in the first place.55
The</p>
<p><em>Global Times</em> editor, Hu Xijin, deployed a bizarre and
memorable analogy, comparing the diplomatic boycott to “the chicken feet
that they eat when drinking”—a worthless, meatless snack for a drunkard.
He described the boycott as a “fiasco” and a “little chicken foot,”
concluding that “Only a drunkard would see it as a meal and eat it up
with such relish”.57</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> This “hum” of ridicule represents a
distinct tactic within the Minimiser playbook. When faced with a
symbolic action that cannot be easily stopped or retaliated against
without appearing petty and validating the protest, the narrative
strategy shifts to trivializing the action itself. The goal is to strip
the boycott of its intended moral and political significance. By
portraying the decision as a foolish, irrelevant, and pathetic gesture,
the “hum” aims to create the impression that the protest has failed and
is having no impact. This narrative is designed to discourage other
countries (The Compliant) from joining the boycott and to reassure a
domestic audience that China’s international standing remains
unaffected.</p>

id="part-v-the-albanese-government-2022-present---the-stabilisation-gambit"><strong>Part
V: The Albanese Government (2022-Present) - The ‘Stabilisation’
Gambit</strong></h2>
<p>The election of the Albanese government in May 2022 marked a
deliberate strategic shift in the tone and methodology of Australia’s
China policy. By prioritizing a “Maximiser” vector of “stabilisation”
and the resumption of high-level dialogue, Canberra successfully induced
a corresponding and immediate moderation in the official Chinese
“hum”.58 This shift demonstrated the transactional nature of Beijing’s
narrative machine. However, a deeper analysis reveals that while the
surface-level “hum” has quieted on economic and diplomatic fronts, the
underlying hostile Minimiser narratives remain potent and are readily
deployed whenever core Australian security policies, such as AUKUS and
the defense of the status quo in Taiwan, are addressed.</p>
<h3
id="subsection-5.1-maximiser-vector---resumption-of-dialogue-and-stabilisation"><strong>Subsection
5.1: Maximiser Vector - Resumption of Dialogue and
‘Stabilisation’</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Australian Action:</strong> Upon taking office, the Albanese
government immediately signaled a change in approach from the
confrontational rhetoric of its predecessor. Foreign Minister Penny Wong
and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese framed the new policy as one of
“stabilisation,” emphasizing the need to “cooperate where we can,
disagree where we must”.59 This “Maximiser” vector was put into practice
through the swift resumption of high-level ministerial and leader-level
meetings, which had been frozen for several years, culminating in
Albanese’s visit to Beijing in 2023.58</p>
<p><strong>Chinese “Hum”:</strong> The official “hum” from Beijing
underwent a dramatic and positive transformation. The hostile and
derogatory language of the Morrison era was replaced with a narrative of
renewed cooperation. Chinese Premier Li Qiang publicly praised Prime
Minister Albanese for his “personal efforts” in bringing the
relationship back from a “low point” and returning it to the “right
track of stability and development”.61 Chinese state media consistently
echoed this theme, hailing the renewed dialogue as a sign of a “mutually
beneficial joint outcome” and a return to “win-win cooperation”.62 This
response is a clear “hum” of reward, mirroring the positive reception
given to the Gillard government’s Strategic Partnership and the Abbott
government’s finalization of ChAFTA.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> This sequence clearly demonstrates the
transactional and highly responsive nature of the Chinese “hum.” A
change in Australian rhetoric and diplomatic posture was immediately met
with a corresponding change in the tone and content of Chinese state
media. This serves a dual purpose for the Minimisation Plan. First, it
directly rewards the Albanese government’s approach, providing positive
reinforcement for its “stabilisation” policy. Second, it sends a
powerful message to The Compliant within Australia—the business
community, academia, and the public—that this new, less confrontational
path is the “correct” one for restoring economic benefits and reducing
geopolitical tension.</p>
<h3
id="subsection-5.2-persistent-minimiser-undercurrents---aukus-and-taiwan"><strong>Subsection
5.2: Persistent Minimiser Undercurrents - AUKUS and Taiwan</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Australian Action:</strong> Despite the overarching policy of
“stabilisation,” the Albanese government has not reversed any of the
substantive “Minimiser” security policies of its predecessors.63 It has
remained fully committed to the AUKUS security pact and the acquisition
of nuclear-powered submarines. Furthermore, it has consistently
maintained Australia’s long-standing, bipartisan position on Taiwan:
supporting the “status quo” and opposing any unilateral change to it by
either side.61</p>
<p><strong>Chinese “Hum”:</strong> On these core security issues, the
hostile “hum” persists, albeit often as a strategic undercurrent rather
than the dominant public narrative. Beijing continues to wage a
sustained diplomatic and media campaign to discredit AUKUS, variously
labeling Australia as a “pawn” of the United States, warning of a
regional arms race, and raising unfounded concerns about nuclear
proliferation.66 Regarding Taiwan, the “hum” has employed more subtle
information operations. Following the 2023 meeting between Albanese and
Xi Jinping, Chinese state media reports deliberately misrepresented
Australia’s position. They claimed that Albanese had stated Australia
“does not support Taiwan’s independence,” a subtle but critical
distortion of Australia’s actual policy, which is to not support</p>
<p><em>unilateral changes</em> to the status quo from <em>either</em>
side.61 This reframing falsely implies a shift in Australia’s position
closer to that of Beijing.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> This dynamic reveals the clear limits of
the “stabilisation” policy. While Beijing is willing to moderate the
“hum” on economic and general diplomatic fronts as a reward for
de-escalation, it will continue to deploy hostile and manipulative
narratives on what it considers non-negotiable core security interests.
The misrepresentation of Albanese’s Taiwan stance is a classic Minimiser
information tactic, designed to create ambiguity, sow confusion, and
falsely signal to a global audience that Australia’s strategic alignment
is weakening.</p>
<p>The Albanese era demonstrates that “stabilisation” has not ended the
narrative war; it has merely changed the battlefield conditions. The
Minimisation Plan is highly adaptable. It can simultaneously project a
positive “hum” of cooperation on economic matters while running a
negative, manipulative “hum” on security matters. This bifurcated
approach represents a more complex form of behavioral conditioning.
Beijing is attempting to strategically “split” Australian policy,
rewarding the economic half while continuing to punish and undermine the
security half. The long-term objective of this dual-track “hum” is to
progressively increase the political and economic cost of Australia’s
security alliance with the United States. By making cooperation in
profitable areas appear contingent on concessions in security, Beijing
pressures Canberra to de-emphasize or decouple its security posture from
its economic relationship. This serves the Minimisation Plan’s core
objective of eroding the institutional and political cohesion of the
Western alliance system.</p>
<hr />
<h2
id="conclusion-decoding-the-hum---patterns-precedents-and-projections"><strong>Conclusion:
Decoding the Hum - Patterns, Precedents, and Projections</strong></h2>
<p>The chronological analysis of the Australia-China relationship from
2010 to the present, viewed through the framework of the Minimisation
Plan, reveals that the “hum” from Chinese state-controlled media is not
a monolithic or purely emotional reaction. It is a sophisticated,
calibrated, and adaptive toolkit of strategic narratives designed to
condition Australian policy, influence public perception, and advance
the PRC’s geopolitical objectives. The patterns identified over more
than a decade of interactions are consistent, predictable, and provide a
clear playbook for understanding Beijing’s information warfare
doctrine.</p>
<p>The “hum” can be categorized into a distinct set of operational
states, each deployed in response to specific types of Australian
actions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Positive/Encouraging Hum:</strong> Deployed as a reward
for “Maximiser” vectors that deepen economic and diplomatic integration.
This was observed with the Gillard government’s Strategic Partnership,
the Abbott government’s finalization of ChAFTA, and the Albanese
government’s policy of “stabilisation.” The narrative is one of “win-win
cooperation,” “mutual trust,” and “shared prosperity.”<br />
</li>
<li><strong>The Hostile/Strategic Hum:</strong> Deployed against major
“Minimiser” security vectors that strengthen the US alliance. This was
most clearly seen in response to the US Marine rotation in Darwin and
the AUKUS pact. The core narratives are “encirclement,” “Cold War
mentality,” “arms race,” and accusations of Australia acting as a “pawn”
for the US.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>The Hostile/Moral Hum:</strong> Deployed against actions
perceived as moral or historical offenses, particularly those involving
Japan. The reaction to the Abbott government’s praise for Japanese WWII
soldiers is the prime example, utilizing narratives of historical
grievance and insult to the victims of Japanese aggression.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>The Hostile/Delegitimizing Hum:</strong> Deployed against
sovereign domestic actions aimed at countering Chinese influence, such
as the Foreign Interference Legislation and the Huawei bans. This “hum”
relies on a “Victimhood Reversal,” framing the defensive measures as
acts of “prejudice,” “hysteria,” “discrimination,” and “political
motivation.”<br />
</li>
<li><strong>The Hostile/Derogatory Hum:</strong> Deployed as a direct
prelude to overt economic coercion. The description of Australia as “gum
on the sole of China’s shoe” in response to the COVID-19 inquiry call
immediately preceded the imposition of trade sanctions, indicating that
this level of denigration signals a shift from narrative pressure to
tangible punishment.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>The Dismissive/Ridicule Hum:</strong> Deployed against
symbolic “Minimiser” actions that cannot be easily countered or punished
without appearing weak, such as the diplomatic boycott of the Beijing
Olympics. The narrative trivializes the action, comparing it to “chicken
feet for a drunkard” to strip it of its moral significance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on this established playbook, analysts can develop a predictive
framework for anticipating the nature of the “hum” in response to future
Australian actions. Any further deepening of the AUKUS pact or the US
alliance will trigger the “encirclement” and “arms race” hum. Any
high-profile Australian criticism of China’s human rights record will be
met with the “prejudice” and “interference in internal affairs” hum. Any
significant independent security action in the region will inevitably be
met with threats and accusations of Australia being a “pawn” provoking
conflict. Conversely, any major new economic or diplomatic initiative
will be met with the positive “hum” of “win-win cooperation,”
demonstrating the continued transactional nature of the
relationship.</p>
<p>The battle for the allegiance of “The Compliant” in Australia is the
central contest in this theatre of the rhizomatic war. The Minimisation
Plan seeks to exploit the tension between economic prosperity and
national security, using its narrative apparatus to amplify the
perceived costs of the latter and the rewards of the former. For
Australian policymakers and the public, understanding the consistent and
predictable patterns of the “hum” is the first and most critical step in
recognizing, inoculating against, and ultimately countering the
narrative warfare of the Minimisation Plan.1</p>
